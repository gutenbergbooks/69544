<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;'>A &nbsp;NECESSARY &nbsp;FOREWORD.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> presenting for perusal a selection of
private notes dealing with the sometimes
eccentric doings of my gallant friend and
compatriot, Captain the Hon. Bernard
O’Hagan, V.C., D.S.O., I desire in the first
place to assure my reader that O’Hagan is
in no degree related to anyone else of the
name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Recent circumstances have led him to
resume military duties; but the splendid
response of Democracy to the trumpet-call
“Pro Patrià” has in no way unsettled his
singular opinions. In the face of evidence
to the contrary which many regard as conclusive,
he maintains that the ideal form of
government is government by an absolute
monarchy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It forms no part of my plan either to
support or to seek to disprove the theories
of Captain O’Hagan. In justice to my
distinguished friend, I must add that support
and opposition alike are matters of indifference
to him. He stands alone—aloof—aloft.
Neither as apologist nor as eulogist do I
pen these lines, but merely as the chronicler
of remarkable events in the career of a
remarkable man.</p>

<div><h1>EXPLOIT THE FIRST.<br/> HE PATRONISES PAMELA.</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk1-1'><span style='font-size:x-large'>I.</span><br/> THE HAT OF MR. PARKINS.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>A very</span> wilderness is Bernard O’Hagan,
which no man could hope thoroughly to
explore; a most picturesque figure in the
satin-lined cloak which he loves to wear in
defiance of fashion and indeed of civilised
custom, singularly resembling the Merry
Monarch whom a lady of his race once
entertained right regally at the ancestral
home of the O’Hagans. The unexpectedness
of the man is one of the most marked features
of his character—the one that makes his
society at once delightful and alarming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My boy,” he will burst out, as we sit
in a crowded café, “that gentleman yonder
is unduly interested in my appearance.”
And, stepping over to the offensive one:
“Sir, you are staring at me. I suspect you
of being a bum-bailiff!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” says the other, in all probability—whilst,
my friend and I the observed of
many observers, I tremble for the outcome
of the affair—“how dare you! Damn it!
how dare you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” replies O’Hagan, with a sort
of calm ferocity, “I desire to pull your
nose, and only await a fitting opportunity!
You are a puppy, sir! There is my card!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man leaps in anger to his feet. Others
arise, too, and waiters approach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will regret this outrage!” says the
man, pale or inflamed. “You will hear
from my solicitor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then O’Hagan throws back his picturesque
head and laughs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The solicitor again!” he cries, snapping
his fingers. “Always the solicitor—or the
police! Is there no man alive to-day who
can fight his own battles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He quietly returns to his table. The
other speaks to the manager, and, if he be
a good customer, the manager comes across
to O’Hagan. O’Hagan rises slowly, fixing
his eyes upon him. And, somehow, O’Hagan
is never ejected. A devil of a fellow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the charge that he is a polished kind
of bully he will reply calmly, arguing that he
is merely of a sensitive and aristocratic
temperament and suffers affront where one
more callous would be conscious of none.
He will submit to rudeness from no man,
be he premier or potman; yet he is never
vulgarly embroiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan rarely wears a hat during the
day. There is a simple explanation. At
one time in his chequered career, the only
presentable hat he possessed was a crush-hat.
It was then that he cultivated the
hatless fashion. This habit of going hatless
directly led to his meeting with Pamela.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan was walking along a
crowded, shop-lined thoroughfare, with that
swinging stride which he will tell you runs
in the family, and which enabled his ancestor
Patrick to secure enrolment in the ranks of
the Musketeers of Louis XIII. Before the
door of a newsagent’s establishment—quite
an unpretentious little shop—two men stood.
One of them, elderly, waved a tweed cap—to
a girl more than ordinarily pretty who was
making her way up the steps to the roof of
a moving motor bus. The girl carried a
neat brown leather case, and, having gained
a seat, turned and waved her handkerchief.
The younger man smiled sourly, but did not
join the elder in his waving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, delighted with the girl’s animation
and beauty, halted by the two, smiling
at the retreating figure. Quite mechanically
he raised the hard felt hat from the head
of the younger and less enthusiastic man,
and waved it with a vigour even more
marked than that of the elder waver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was recalled to the scene from which
the girl now had disappeared amid the
motley traffic, by a violent punch in the ribs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blighter!” said a coarse voice. “My
’at!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another than Captain O’Hagan had turned
quickly, with arm raised to ward off another
possible blow. But with O’Hagan the cult
of the unusual is a creed to which he sacrifices
daily. Some difficulty he experienced in
suppressing a gasp, but he turned unhastily,
calmly, and looked into the bright little
eyes of the hat’s owner. These were set
upon him wickedly, and a truculent, blue-shaded
jaw was thrust forward in menace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve properly asked for it,” continued
the man, tensely, “and you’re goin’ to
get it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jem!” protested the older man, fearfully.
“Not here——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Straight from the shoulder a piston stroke
was launched at O’Hagan. It was a blow
with brawn to drive it, with science to direct
it. It was aimed—and well—in accordance
with ring traditions of the “knock-out.”
But one who takes unwarrantable liberties
with unknowns’ hats must be prepared for
reprisals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan is fond of showing his friends
the tricks learned of Shashu Myuku of
Nagasaki; he is equally prompt to demonstrate
them to others. Without employing
his right hand, which was engaged in holding
the felt hat, he struck down the impending
blow (any but a pupil of Myuku must have
endeavoured to strike it <span class='it'>up</span>), thrust his left
foot rapidly against his opponent’s advanced
right shin, and, by a simple process of
natural law the pugilist pitched forward
on to the pavement, propelled by all the
force of his own attacking impetus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much shaken, and with a rivulet of blood
trickling down his nose from a damaged forehead,
he got upon his feet again. Captain
O’Hagan deliberately hurled the bowler far
out into the stream of traffic, and fixed his
large eyes upon its white-faced owner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One word,” he said, in that tone of
suppressed ferocity wholly inimitable, “and
I will throw you after it! You ape!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dazed and much-insulted man glanced
from a shapeless dark mass which, prior to
the passage of a brewer’s traction-engine,
had been a felt hat, to the face of O’Hagan;
and began with his handkerchief to wipe
blood from his wounds. O’Hagan cast his
eyes upward to the legend: “J. Crichton,
Newsagent,” and took the elder man by the
arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A word with you, Mr. Crichton!” he
said, sweeping that astonished old tradesman
into the shop, and ignoring the knot of
interested spectators gathered at the door.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk1-2'><span style='font-size:x-large'>II.</span><br/> “THE ART OF GENTLE THOUGHT.”</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>A chair</span> stood by the journal-strewn counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down,” said O’Hagan kindly, “and
answer a few questions! Who is that person
whose hat I honoured?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newsagent, who momentarily was
expecting to awaken from this bad dream,
shook his head ominously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Jem Parkins, sir,” he replied, with
that respect bordering upon awe which
O’Hagan inspires in the plebeian soul. “He’s
got the <span class='it'>Blue Dragon</span> now, but he’s ex-middleweight
champion. There’ll be the devil to
pay when he’s pulled hisself together, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reserve your speculations, Mr.
Crichton,” said O’Hagan, “and confine yourself
to facts. The young lady on the bus—your
daughter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She takes after her mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Crichton stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you know Polly—Mrs. Crichton, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I was referring to your daughter’s
good looks. She dresses neatly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Crichton had something of the British
tradesman’s independent spirit, and even the
awe inspired by O’Hagan’s tremendous
presence could not wholly smother his paternal
resentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d have you know that Pamela’s a lady,
sir! And I’d have——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pamela is quite an unusual name for a
girl of the lower classes. In what way is
Parkins interested?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mild eye of Mr. J. Crichton smouldered
into faint flame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The lower classes! The——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I asked you a question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Crichton hesitated, glanced around
his shop—his <span class='it'>own</span> shop—noted that his
pugilistic friend was entering the door with
an air of business-like truculence, and took
his elusive courage in both hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I decline to be cross-examined—by you—or—by——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Parkins closed the shop-door, bolted
it, and pulled down the blue blind. He
began deliberately to remove his coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Half a mo, Mr. C.,” he interrupted in a
quivering voice. “Sorry to put you out, but
it’s got to be done. I’ll smash ’im; then
you can call for the police and give ’im in
charge!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan raised the monocle swung upon
the broad black ribbon, and holding it at
some distance from his right eye, surveyed
the speaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I forbade you to address me?”
he remarked icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parkins, removing a collar and shirt-front
combined, began to whistle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll show you comin’ buttin’ in and
runnin’ after respectable girls!” he announced
hoarsely. “<span class='it'>Blighter!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan dropped the monocle and laid
his cane upon the counter. At the moment
that Parkins stood upright and squared his
chest, the Captain snatched up Mr. Crichton’s
day-book—a heavy, leather-bound volume—and
hurled it full at the pugilist’s head. One
of the precepts of the Higher Jiu-jitsu, or
“Art of Gentle Thought,” he will tell you, is
to avail yourself of any missile within reach.
His aim, then, is deadly. The day-book
struck Parkins edgewise across the face,
felling him like a stricken bullock—felling
him utterly, brutally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crashed into the corner by the door—and
lay still. (“A dreadful blow was struck
at every gentleman when the sword was
taken from him,” O’Hagan will say. “One
cannot soil one’s gloves with the blood of
churls.”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you compel me to deal with you,”
said the Captain, as Parkins returned to
groaning consciousness of his injuries, “I
shall cut your ears off!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do not judge my friend harshly. He was
born three centuries too late, that is all.
The claim of Democracy to an equality with
Aristocracy is as unintelligible to him as it
must have been to Denis O’Hagan, who
upheld the Stuart cause whilst he had breath,
and died at last like a gentleman at Worcester,
having demonstrated his distaste for plebeian
company by personally dispatching seven
Roundheads. Or perhaps the autocratic soul
of Patrick O’Hagan lives again within
Bernard. This member of the family, sometime
of the <span class='it'>Mousquetaires du roi</span>, narrowly
escaped the Bastille for decapitating a Paris
grocer who insulted a lady and attaching the
erring tradesman’s head to his own shop-sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parkins dizzily strove to get upon his
feet. Mr. Crichton, trembling, was seeking
to reach the telephone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Mr. Crichton,” directed
O’Hagan, turning the monocle upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my shop—and that’s one o’ my
friends——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Mr. Crichton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Crichton sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You”—to the tottering pugilist—“put
on your filthy rags, and get out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parkins steadied himself against the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’you mean, get out? I’ve got
more right ’ere than you! Just wait, you
cowardly skunk! I’ll ’ave you yet! I’ll
quod you for this!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have one minute to get out. If I
hear from you again, I shall give you in
charge for assault and battery!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, lolling against the counter, swung
the monocle carelessly. The amplitude of
his nonchalance prevailed. Parkins, recalling
that he had struck the first blow, stuffed
his “dicky” into his coat, resumed that
garment, and began to unbolt the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With never a backward glance, the discredited
Mr. Parkins made his exit. One of
a curious group, without, entered on the
pretence of buying a halfpenny paper. He
was served by the trembling newsagent, but
save for the presence of a hatless, distinguished
gentleman, saw nothing to satisfy
his curiosity in Mr. Crichton’s shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mr. Crichton,” said O’Hagan, the
customer departed, “in reference to Pamela:
has the fellow, Parkins, pretensions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Crichton, <span class='it'>pro tempore</span>, was past protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s an old pal o’ mine,” he explained,
unsteadily, “and well off—and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pamela does not approve him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she’s got such superior ideas. But
Parkins——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is out of the question, Crichton.
Dismiss the idea. Mrs. Crichton was a
woman of higher social standing than yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newsagent felt suffocation to be an
imminent danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She was the daughter of a lit’r’y gentleman——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Singular that she should have married
you! Her father was badly in debt, possibly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, possibly the late Mrs. Crichton’s
father was financially indebted to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crichton, cowed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pretty well kept him, for years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! poor girl! A tragedy of poverty!
But you have not neglected Pamela’s education?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s had the best that money could
give her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan seized the hand of the bewildered
Mr. Crichton and wrung it warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are redeeming features in your
character, Crichton!” he said. “For your
endeavours on the girl’s behalf I can forgive
you much. Rely upon my friendship! And
Pamela has literary inclinations?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” answered the newsagent, whose
world was being turned topsy-turvy, who
alternately believed that he was in the company
of a madman or that he himself was
mad. “She’s a musician; I’ve had her
properly taught; she composes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Above all the chaos reigning in his mind,
paternal pride asserted its sovereignty and
his voice proclaimed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! composes? She has just gone to
see a publisher? She had music in the
leather case?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her new piece, sir. She reckons it’s
goin’ to make her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has she published?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Crichton, crestfallen:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, sir! You see, she’s unknown.
They won’t give her a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will return to lunch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newsagent stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pamela’ll be home to dinner!” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The midday meal? Exactly. I will
lunch with you, Crichton. My name is
Captain O’Hagan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mode of patronage was superb, incomparable.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk1-3'><span style='font-size:x-large'>III.</span><br/> PAMELA RETURNS.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Pamela</span> arrived late, a dainty figure in her
neat serge costume; but the very curl that
floated across her brow, the limp little hand
that held the music-case, spoke of dejection.
Her charming face was not habitually pale,
O’Hagan felt assured, nor were such glorious
eyes meant to be dimmed with threatening
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Pam!” began her father heartily—and
hesitated. “Why—won’t they take
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A forlorn little shake of the head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That horrible Ritzmann offered to
publish it—if I would let him have it for
nothing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For nothing! Didn’t he offer to pay
anything?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not after I had declined to go to lunch
with him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pamela laughed; not mirthfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cheer up, Pam,” said Mr. Crichton,
in a voice of abysmal gloom. “A—er—a
friend——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A friend, yes, Crichton,” interrupted
O’Hagan. “Don’t be nervous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A friend of mine—<span class='it'>Captain</span> O’Hagan—has
called to see us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pamela blushed delightfully; O’Hagan
bowed inimitably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t Mr.—Parkins—stay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crichton coughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He couldn’t stop, after all!” He replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pamela removed her hat. “Good job,
too,” she muttered under her breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then began that singular repast,
throughout which O’Hagan talked as only
O’Hagan can talk; talked himself into the
hearts of the Crichtons. The old man’s
natural resentment—which hitherto had not
become wholly dispersed—melted before the
geniality of his distinguished guest; Mr.
Parkins was forgotten. Pamela forgot her
troubles and became all smiles. Crichton
burned with pride to note that Captain
O’Hagan treated her as an intellectual
equal. Of the Captain’s honourable and
friendly intentions no man could doubt after
thirty minutes in his company; and so that
was a happy hour spent at the newsagent’s
humble table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meal despatched:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now for the music!” said O’Hagan, and
crossing the little room, he opened the piano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pamela stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I try over your new piece, Miss
Crichton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” cried the girl. “You play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little. I should like, as a pleasure, to
hear your own rendering; as a matter of
business I should prefer to play the piece
myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A matter of business——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You hope to place these compositions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Pamela blankly; “yes,”
and took the MS. from her music-case,
adjusting it upon the piano-rack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Few people have heard O’Hagan play the
piano. He never plays unless requested
and the many being ignorant of his accomplishment,
he rarely is requested. But from
the moment that his long, white fingers
caressed the keys in the opening bar until
that when they leapt back from the final
chord, his audience of two listened spellbound.
The piece was a delicate, feminine
morsel; individual, charming; upon an
elusive melody, which haunted the ear,
which spelt Popularity. For a moment there
was silence. O’Hagan swung around and
faced Pamela.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Crichton,” he said, “you will make
a large sum of money with your music.
One day you will be famous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pamela blushed; her lips trembled. She
had never heard her dainty composition
played before by hands other than her own.
It was something of a revelation to its composer—this
rippling, fascinating cascade of
harmony which had flown out under the
subtle touch of the visitor. Tears were not
far from her eyes again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me more of your pieces—all you
can find,” directed O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Glad enough of an excuse to hide her emotion,
the girl ran to a little escretoire and
took out six or seven neatly-written compositions.
O’Hagan placed them before him,
and played through them all, without hesitation,
without error; with intense sympathy
and understanding. Soon she was beside
him, turning over the familiar pages; her
wayward curls brushed his cheek. When
the master-touch had sounded the finale of
the last piece, old Crichton pulled out a
handkerchief and blew his nose in clarion
fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What terms were you asking of—er—Ritzmann?”
said the Captain abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The usual ten per cent.,” replied Pamela,
“with—something on account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much on account?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ritzmann, I have heard—I know—usually
gives ten guineas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke the words with awe. Ten
guineas on account of a composition of <span class='it'>hers</span>—of
her very own! It was a dream!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Ten guineas on account of a ten
per cent, royalty? Let me see: we have
eight pieces here. Can you find two more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a suite of three short numbers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pamela found it, and brought it. O’Hagan
played it, and was delighted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Four sharps,” he criticised, “are bad in
a composition designed for general popularity.
Would it lose by transposition into a more
simple key?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think not,” said Pamela.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” continued O’Hagan, “it is a
matter for discussion later. May I take
these with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course!” said Pamela. “But——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you give me until Thursday to place
them for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To place them! To place <span class='it'>all</span> of them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of them! Can you give me until
Thursday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pamela’s pretty eyes were widely staring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You overwhelm me! Do you really
mean it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you wait until Thursday and see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course!” said Pamela.</p>

<p class='line0' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk1-4'><span style='font-size:x-large'>IV.</span><br/> A MUSICAL INTERLUDE.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>O’Hagan entered</span> my rooms with the impressive
dignity of a Richelieu; in the very
distinction of the man there is something
opulent. His refined <span class='it'>insouciance</span> surpasses
anything of the kind one could imagine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you do me a trifling service, Raymond?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Consider it as done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw himself into the blue Chesterfield
lounge with the native grace no lesser
man could hope to imitate. His pose suggested
that a rapier hung at his hip and must
be taken into consideration. A plumed hat
would have struck no discordant note but
merely have harmonised with the purple-lined
cloak. O’Hagan’s head one might
surmise to be from a study by Van Dyck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am running around to Ritzmann’s, the
music-publishers, in Berners Street.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I noted that he carried a full portfolio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last you have decided to enter the
field? You do wisely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am acting on behalf of a friend—a
lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed. What part do I play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along. I will explain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We walked up Oxford Street to the corner
of Berners Street. O’Hagan creates a sensation
wherever he appears: I am hardened
to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will reconnoitre, Raymond. You
will send in a card—anybody’s card but your
own—to Mr. Paul Ritzmann.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are representing Messrs. Angelo
Morris, of Monte Video! Probably there is
no such firm; I invented the name. You
are prepared to handle Ritzmann’s dance-catalogue
throughout the southern continent.
If he declines to do business, no matter;
if he is interested, make an appointment at
your hotel—the Savoy sounds substantial
without being gaudy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the object of this mendacity?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To learn if there is a second door to
Ritzmann’s office; another than that opening
on the shop. If there is, come out by it
at all costs, and note where it leads you to.
I think, and hope, it will open on a corridor
communicating with the street. From what I
know of Ritzmann I feel confident that there
will be such a private entrance. You will
note, also, where the <span class='it'>other</span> end of this hypothetical
passage leads to. Probably it will
be to a stair. Finally, you will report
respecting the occupant of the suite of offices
above—the suite to which this stair should
conduct you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not confident,” I said; “but I will
do my best.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three minutes later I was ushered into
the Semitic presence of Mr. Paul Ritzmann.
Mr. Ritzmann had a corpulent person, a
bald head, and an oily smile. He wore
diamond rings on his left hand as well as on
his right, by which token I knew that he was
really rich. A Hebrew of the Ritzmann
type buys a diamond ring as soon as he can
afford it, and displays it upon his right hand.
That is an advertising investment; it signifies
that he is ambitious. But when his right
hand is full and he begins to adorn his left
it implies that his ambition is realised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made no plunge at my South American
offer. He was very cautious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will give you a ring at the hotel, Mr.
Eddington.” (I had sent in the card of
Harry Eddington, who at the time was with
an expedition looking for the South Pole.)
“I dare say we may be able to fix something
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I made a plunge for a door on the left of
his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This way out, Mr. Eddington,” came after
me; but I was in the corridor, and closed the
door behind me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A white hand with extended fingers was
painted on the further wall, and, beneath it,
the words:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style='margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;'>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Turning to the right, I passed out into
Berners Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well,” said O’Hagan, musingly,
when I had made my report. “You will
now get back to the said corridor, without
permitting yourself to be seen from Ritzmann’s
shop; you will wait by Ritzmann’s
private door, but on the stair side, so that
when I come out he won’t notice you. I
shall hand you something; you will go up
Harris and Harris’s stair like a rocket, concealing,
of course, the object referred to,
and see about a cook. Then go home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One pays for the privilege of O’Hagan’s
friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had not been at my post more than half
a minute, when I saw O’Hagan pass in the
street and enter the Ritzmann shop. I
began to make notes in a note-book to excuse
my loitering. Leaving me so engaged, you
will please follow the Captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a counter-clerk:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kindly inform Mr. Ritzmann,” he said,
“that the gentleman he is expecting will
see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir. Certainly, sir. Will you take
a seat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, the shop staff were decided, was
either a distinguished Russian composer or a
gentleman of title interested in a new musical
comedy for the “Gaiety.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Ritzmann will see you at once, sir.
This way, if you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan swung grandly office-ward, and
entered to find Ritzmann standing to greet
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clerk was about to retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My good fellow,” called O’Hagan, “Mr.
Ritzmann and I are not to be interrupted
upon any account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clerk bowed and retired. Ritzmann
stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say I was expecting you, Mr.——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan smiled, waving his hand reassuringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray be seated, Mr. Ritzmann.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ritzmann accepted the invitation, and
O’Hagan sat upon the edge of the desk
facing him. O’Hagan was between Mr. Ritzmann
and the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have decided to place with you for
immediate publication a parcel of charming
compositions—nine in all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ritzmann’s eyes began to protrude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are these.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan opened the portfolio and set the
heap of MSS. on the desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With frequent sideway glances at his
extraordinary visitor, Mr. Ritzmann began
to look at the music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” he burst out, suddenly, pushing
the whole of it towards the Captain, “all
this stuff has been submitted by post, and
declined! All but this thing; and Miss
Crichton was here only the other day with it.
I don’t want the junk, my dear sir! If
I’d known that’s what you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan waved him to silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of all these things I am fully aware,
Mr. Ritzmann; but I thought I had explained
that I had selected you to publish
these compositions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other clutched the arms of his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Selected</span> me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was my expression. Had the music
been worthless——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>is</span> worthless! Piffle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had the music been worthless I should
not have offered it to you. But each of these
nine items is a sound speculation. We shall
require nine agreement-forms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ritzmann, staring, rose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Mr. Ritzmann.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ritzmann moistened his thick lips preparatory
to comment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, Mr. Ritzmann.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down; and his fleshy hands were
not quite steady; the diamonds danced and
sparkled. He managed to achieve coherent
speech:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a damn big bluff! But if you
bluff from now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have royalty-forms in your desk;
we shall require nine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ritzmann got on his feet and plunged for
the bell. He was hurled back with violence;
and his eyes protruded unnaturally at sight
of the pistol which pointed at his bald skull.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nine forms, Mr. Ritzmann.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must—be mad. You—dare
not——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are in error. I would shoot
you without compunction. If I failed to
escape I should shoot myself. I have nothing
to live for, and I should go to eternity with
that one good deed to my credit. I will
dictate the titles of the nine pieces and you
will fill in the forms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ritzmann’s face grew ashy. He looked a
stricken man. The bundle of forms shook
and rustled like autumn leaves in a breeze.
Unemotionally, O’Hagan read out the titles;
shakily, all but illegibly, the publisher wrote
them in. Form after form was filled updated
and signed. Two, O’Hagan rejected
as quite illegible. But at last he was satisfied,
and pocketed the nine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten guineas on account of each,” he
said; “that will be a cheque for ninety-four
pounds, ten shillings, payable to Miss
Pamela Crichton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ritzmann’s face showed that he was contemplating
rebellion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall count ten, Mr. Ritzmann!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheque was drawn up and signed.
O’Hagan carefully folded and placed it in
his pocket-book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good day,” he said, and backed towards
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened it and stepped out into the
passage. He had not closed it ere with bell
and husky voice Ritzmann was summoning
assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan handed me the pistol. He took
out his cigarette-case and selected a cigarette.
Before he had found his matchbox I was
upstairs and inside Messrs. Harris and Harris’s
office. It must have been at about the
moment when I was stating my lack of a
suitable parlourmaid, that three clerks, rushing
out of the shop, intercepted the Captain,
as, match in hand, he stood at the street-end
of the passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They would have seized him; but
O’Hagan’s eyes can quell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your dirty hands off! The meaning of
this outrage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trembling, grey-faced, Mr. Ritzmann
joined the three clerks. A fourth, who had
been detailed to that duty, returned from an
adjacent corner with a constable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arrest that man! He has robbed me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan closed his matchbox with a
<span class='it'>click</span> and fixed his eyes upon the officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Constable,” he said, with dignity, “step
into the shop. This is an outrage for which
Mr. Ritzmann shall pay. Step inside if you
please—all of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wide-eyed clerks returned to the shop.
Ritzmann, never taking his gaze from
O’Hagan, but keeping at a safe distance,
entered behind the Captain, clutching at
the perplexed policeman and whispering:
“He has robbed me! He’s got my cheque
in his pocket!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having entered the shop,—to the excited
clerks:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Return to your duties, good fellows!”
ordered O’Hagan. “I am not accustomed
to be made an object of vulgar curiosity!
Mr. Ritzmann, lead the way to your office.
Constable—follow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The odd trio entered Ritzmann’s sanctum.
O’Hagan closed the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s dangerous!” cried the publisher.
“He carries a pistol!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan raised his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The officer, Mr. Ritzmann,” he said,
“is prepared to do his duty. But you
have not stated your case. Of what am I
accused?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of extorting money from me, at the
point of a pistol!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Officer! You have my permission to
look for the weapon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The constable ran his hands over O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, sir,” he reported to Mr.
Ritzmann, who was now regaining colour and
perspiring freely, “but the gentleman hasn’t
got any pistol on him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s dropped it in the passage!” yelled
Ritzmann. “He——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again O’Hagan raised the forceful hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of your clerks can go and look;
and would you be good enough to request
your manager to join us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The necessary instructions were given, and
the manager appeared. O’Hagan threw down
his bunch of agreements and displayed
the cheque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” he said to the manager, “are these
in order?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He made me do it!” cried Ritzmann
hoarsely, “at the point of a pistol!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shopman entered to report that there
was no pistol in the passage. Ritzmann
began to swear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence!” thundered O’Hagan.
“Silence! you contemptible scoundrel!”
To the manager: “Are those agreements
and this cheque quite regular?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said the manager, glancing deprecatingly
at his employer—“I can see nothing
irregular about them. They are in your
writing, Mr. Ritzmann!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He held a pistol to my head!” cried
the publisher. “You’re a pack of fools!
Fools! Officer! will you do your duty and
arrest that thief!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan took a stride towards the speaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop him!” quavered Ritzmann, paling.
“He——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Ritzmann,” said O’Hagan calmly,
“you are a low blackguard! Repenting of
your bargain, you invented this cock-and-bull
story as a means of evading it! Knowing
me to be a man who has led an
adventurous life, you thought yourself safe
in charging me with carrying arms! I have
several witnesses to the fact that you have
grossly slandered me. That your charge is
absurd—insane—worthy of a ‘penny-dreadful’—renders
it none the less slanderous.
You will either apologise, here and
now, or—there is my card. My solicitor will
take charge of the matter in the morning!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Down on to the desk before the bewildered
Ritzmann, O’Hagan cast his card. Like
everything appertaining to that remarkable
man, his card is impressive, unusual, striking;
a battery. Mr. Ritzmann, his manager and
the constable, read the following:</p>

</table>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>The constable stood stiffly to attention,
and saluted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What am I to do, sir?” he asked—of
O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ring up Gerrard 04385!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ritzmann dropped into his chair and sat
there with bulging eyes. The constable,
amid a surprising silence, took up the telephone
and got the desired number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask if that is the Junior Guards,”
directed O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, it was the Junior Guards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See if Colonel Sir Gerald Fitz Ayre is in
the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name of that celebrated soldier electrified
the Captain’s audience. Fitz Ayre
was found and came to the telephone.
O’Hagan took the receiver from the now
extremely respectful officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you, Fitz Ayre? Yes; O’Hagan
speaking. My confounded eccentricities of
costume have got me into hot water again!
Will you please <span class='it'>describe me</span> to the person who
is now coming to the ’phone! Yes. Thank
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ritzmann, summoned imperiously, took
the receiver in his trembling hands. But
he did not listen to the Colonel’s florid
description of O’Hagan’s person; for his
mind was otherwise engaged. He knew himself
the victim of a tremendous bluff, but,
now, he knew the bluffer for one above his
reach; he knew, moreover, that he lacked
evidence, and that he had been guilty of a
slander which might cost him thousands.
Pamela Crichton’s music was quite saleable.
He would lose nothing by the deal;
he would see to that. His course was
clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ritzmann turned to O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I apologise, Captain O’Hagan!” he said.
“I was mad! Officer—a sovereign for
you!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.5em;'>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I present my friend, Mr. Lawrence
Raymond?” said O’Hagan. “This is Miss
Pamela Crichton, the clever composer I
spoke about! Isn’t she a picture?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was. But she blushed furiously.
O’Hagan handed her a bundle of agreements.
As she looked through them, her flushed
cheeks grew quite pale. When a cheque
for ninety guineas was placed in her hands,
frankly, I thought she would have swooned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Crichton, hovering about in the dingy
background, showed as a man who is dazed
beyond comprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Captain O’Hagan,” began Pamela,
and her pretty eyes were troubled, “how
can I thank you! Why have you done
this—for <span class='it'>me</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you are <span class='it'>you</span>, Pamela!” said
O’Hagan. “Because you are so very charming,
and because one day you will be so
very famous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pamela met his eyes frankly—and was
content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout our brief stay, O’Hagan’s
treatment of the girl was worthy of the days
of chivalry. Never, for a moment, did he
presume upon that superiority of blood
which is so real in his eyes, nor upon the
service he had done this newsagent’s daughter.
When we took our leave he kissed her hand
in his astonishing, cavalierly way, tactfully
ignoring her sweet confusion, clapped her
father patronisingly upon the back—and
swung out of the shop, a gentleman full three
hundred years behind his time—the only
living being who has recovered the Grand
Manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You would like to meet my friend O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>That</span> class distinctions should be marked
by insuperable barriers is a theory that
amounts to a religion with O’Hagan. The
<span class='it'>caste</span> system of India is delightful to his
exclusiveness. I think, between patricians
and plebeians, he would like to erect a series
of stone hedges. To the voice of Democracy
he is deaf, and would have a governing body
selected from the oldest families in the
kingdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day,” he will declare, “there are
many gentlemen externally indistinguishable
from grocers’ assistants. I know dukes who
look like head waiters, and head waiters who
look like earls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He throws back the folds of his astonishing
satin-lined cloak, more fully to reveal its
inner splendour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, myself,” he confides, “have been mistaken
for an impresario, and once for a professional
conjuror. I have repeatedly been
compelled to thrash my man in order to
check attempts at familiarity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sighs for the days when nobility
unmistakably proclaimed itself; when an
aristocrat was disgraced who dabbled in
commerce and a tradesman castigated who
raised his eyes above the level prescribed for
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A gentleman,” says O’Hagan, “is never
at a loss for the right word at the right time.
He knows when to throw down the gauntlet,
and when to apologise (to his equals). In
this way, factitious gentility often is unmasked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In support of this contention Captain
O’Hagan will tell you a story.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening, at about seven o’clock, he
chanced to be standing upon the corner of
a prosperous suburban avenue in an exclusive,
if slightly snob-ridden, district. As
my memory serves me, he was waiting for
a cab.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merely to say that Captain O’Hagan stands
upon a corner is to do poor justice to the
verity. O’Hagan not only stands upon a
corner; he occupies and ornaments it. With
picturesque head, hatless, aloft—something
of a rebuke to the Lady O’Hagan who was
a contemporary of Charles II.—one gloved
hand resting upon the heavy ebony cane,
two fingers of the other dangling the large
monocle, dependent on its black silk ribbon,
his is a figure for long remembrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the avenue came a lady escorted by
a gentleman. The lady was young and
pretty; her face peeped out from her wraps
bewitchingly; and she carried one of those
feminine sachet arrangements, in which, by
the light of the street lamp, she anxiously
searched. Her companion ransacked his
overcoat pockets, his dress-coat pockets, his
waistcoat and trousers pockets; and even
looked in his crush-hat. When, following a
hurried colloquy, he retraced his steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, his monocle held some three
inches from his left eye, surveyed the charming
figure, which now added a new beauty
to the corner, with critical aesthetic appreciation.
Do not suppose the attention a rude
one. O’Hagan is incapable of rudeness to
a woman. In another it had been rudeness—yes;
but O’Hagan’s frank interest, though
embarrassing, is an exquisite flattery. His
approval is a superb tribute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He approved. The lady was not unaware
of this, nor in the slightest degree displeased.
Returning the forgetful cavalier, the pair
moved away past the Captain. And two
bright eyes acknowledged admiration with
a discreet glance swift as a rapier thrust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Jealousy has as many heads and as
many eyes as Siva; nor has it a lesser
malignancy. The man turned; strode back
to O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, sir, by staring at
my friend in that way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice, his gaze, his attitude, were
truculent. O’Hagan was delighted with such
a display of spirit. He dropped the glass and
bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If your friend has complained of me,
sir, I shall never forgive myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I await no complaint from her. <span class='it'>I</span> am
complaining, confound your impudence!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan raised the glass again, measuring
the depths of the speaker’s resentment.
He considered the words ill-chosen and ill-mannered;
and instantly had revised his
estimate of the speaker’s character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An entirely different matter, sir,” says
he. “<span class='it'>You</span> can go to the devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other flushed and thrust himself nearer
to the suave Captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You overdressed puppy!” he rapped
furiously. “I have a mind to knock you
down!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dropped the monocle; and a slip of pasteboard
was thrust into the hand of the irate man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your card, sir!” demanded O’Hagan.
“At a more fitting time I will afford you
every facility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only exchange cards with gentlemen!
sneered the other, savagely; and tore into
fragments the one he held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your card, sir!” repeated O’Hagan
sternly. “You have insulted me, and I
demand an opportunity to reply to you.
Your card, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be damned to you!” said the other—and
walked off to rejoin the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan was but a pace later beside her.
He bowed, as no man has bowed in England
since the days of plumes and lace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam, permit me to offer you my
most humble apologies for having annoyed
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Innocent eyes, with an imp of mischief
dancing in their shadowed pools, met the
Captain’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mistaken, sir. You have not
annoyed me in the slightest!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“She was a born coquette,” O’Hagan has
confided to me; “but devilish pretty and full
of spirit. Too joyous a nature by far to
dovetail with the sour-jowl who had insulted
me.”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then permit me to apologise for your
friend,” continued the amazing Captain,
“who forces this necessity upon me by
declining his card!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How dare you!” cried the friend, breathless.
“Hang it all! I’ll give you in charge
if you continue to annoy me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your card, sir,” persisted O’Hagan. “It
is unavoidable that you afford me satisfaction
for the insult placed upon me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along, Moira,” breathed the enraged
man, and offered his arm to the girl. “We
shall be late for dinner. Never mind this
lunatic!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They proceeded. O’Hagan paced gloomily
beside them. Some twenty yards thus;
then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clear out, confound you!” cried the
man, turning upon O’Hagan with a leaping
blaze of passion. “By heaven, you will
make me forget myself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have done so already—for which
reason I demand to know where I may find
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Choking—wrought upon to the limit of
his endurance—the other stood, mouth atwitch,
hands clenched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your card, sir,” said O’Hagan icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man addressed snatched again at the
girl’s arm and hurried her onward. Speech,
now, was denied to him; his companion could
feel how he quivered and shook in the gale
of his emotions. Somewhat, she was
frightened; but in part, too, the novelty of
the situation pleased the romantic within her.
She knew not what to say apposite to the
strange impasse, so wisely said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan completed the silent
trio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through a gate whose opening discovered
a carriage-sweep they passed. Upon a neat
lawn lights blazed out from every visible
window of a substantial mansion. The
obstinate and enraged stranger recovered
command of his tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How dare you follow me into these
premises!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not a spy, to follow any man,”
retorted O’Hagan. “I am <span class='it'>accompanying</span>
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bell’s ring brought a trim maid. In
the cosy hall, where a fire crackled good
cheer, and a well-assorted array of hats and
coats bespoke a convivial gathering, several
loungers were revealed. As the sour man
and the pretty girl entered, the unbidden
visitor heard the former mention the name of
the host, “Major Trefusis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan the maid eyed doubtfully.
The new arrival smiled an evil
triumph. But O’Hagan calmly handed his
card to the girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Request Major Trefusis to step this
way!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His pose, as, standing just within the hall,
he raised his glass and surveyed the guests,
was a liberal education in deportment;
his supreme self-possession a pure delight, a
thing humanly inimitable.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk2-2'><span style='font-size:x-large'>II.</span><br/> THE OTHER.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Major Trefusis,</span> retired, with an Indian
liver but a warm heart, made a rushing entry,
O’Hagan’s card in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! brought a friend. Repton?
Delighted to have you, Captain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sour and wrath-sore Repton raised
a protesting hand. His hat and coat the
maid had taken charge of; his pretty companion,
not daring to dally longer, had
escaped into a drawing-room, with a smothered
peal of musical laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One moment, Major!” Mr. Repton drew
his sandy eyebrows together and glared upon
the intruder. “This fellow is no friend of
mine, he imagines that I have offended
him and has followed me here, demanding
my name and address like a confounded
policeman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan fixed his eyes upon Mr. Repton
with quelling glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have likened me to a confounded
policeman, sir. For which new insult I
shall pull your nose!” He turned to Major
Trefusis, in that hour the most surprised
man from Land’s End to John O’Groats.
“Mr. Repton is your guest, Major, and of
him I shall say nothing, except that he has
insulted me; deliberately, and several times.
Our cause of misunderstanding is no concern
of yours, happily; but as a brother officer
and a gentleman you will support my claim
to know where I may call upon Mr. Repton
to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Major’s prominent, Cambridge eyes
regarded the quivering Mr. Repton, whose
wrath yet was badly bottled, and escaped in
divers sibilant exclamations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know, Repton”—he said;
“I mean to say, Repton, the Captain is
within his rights, damme if he’s not! Why
the blazes won’t you give him your card—what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I don’t choose to hand my card
to any ruffian who cares to ask for it, Major!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, Mr. Repton, making an effective
exit by the same opening as the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Trefusis watched him go, and his
red face grew redder, and his wiry moustache
more aggressively porcupinish. He snorted,
cleared his throat, and turned to O’Hagan—who
anticipated him:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I regret this incident exceedingly, Major.
Pray accept my very sincere apologies——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, Captain—not at all! You’re
the O’Hagan who was with the —th Irish
Guards in South Africa—what? Heard of
you! heard of you! Delighted to meet
you! It’s an ill wind—what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They shook hands warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Repton wasn’t my guest—and my
sister’s guest,” continued Major Trefusis,
“I’d say he was a puppy and that I’d always
thought so! But he’s in my house, and I
can’t tell you what he doesn’t want to tell
you himself. You’re just in time for dinner,
Captain!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Major——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me your coat, man——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Major——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers in arms and all that, what!
Damme! you’ve <span class='it'>got</span> to stay!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear I am intruding——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tut! tut! Come and have a peg.
Just time! Were you in Kandahar when——”
etc., etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the pair, arm-in-arm, drifted off
together—more strangely met than any two
the classic muse has sung. O’Hagan’s reluctance
in a degree was sincere, for he had
formed a strong attachment for the Major
at sight and would not gladly have inconvenienced
him. But, on the other hand,
no human power, save of course physically
superior force, could have moved him from
that house until his scrupulous honour was
satisfied. Had his host proved of a different
kidney, then O’Hagan patiently would have
patrolled the neighbourhood until the reappearance
of his man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is recorded, O’Hagan will tell you, that
his ancestor Patrick, sometime of the Musketeers
of Louis XIII., on one occasion
waited for eight hours in the snow outside
the hotel of the Duchesse de C——, in order
to reprimand an unknown nobleman who had
trodden on his corn. But within eight
minutes from the time of the gentleman’s
coming out, Patrick O’Hagan had aroused
the concierge of the Hotel de C—— to take
him in again, summoned a surgeon, summoned
a priest, summoned an undertaker,
and reported for duty at the Louvre. A
bloody ancestor for any man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My friend’s code, then, is peculiar, but
iron-bound. He scrupulously avoided the
topic of Mr. Repton with his host; but when,
later, Mrs. Lestrange, the Major’s sister,
came in to dinner on the arm of Captain
O’Hagan, the countenance of Repton would
have served as model for a Notre Dame
gargoyle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Major, too, had been whispering to
one man: “<span class='it'>The</span> O’Hagan! You recall the
incident at so-and-so?” And to another:
“O’Hagan, V.C.! One of the O’Hagan’s of
Dunnamore!” To a girl: “You must have
read how the Boers ambushed a company of
the So-and-So’s at So-and-So? Kipling has
written about it! Well, this is Captain
O’Hagan, who,” etc., etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So that, altogether, my friend has assured
me that he recalls no more enjoyable evening.
His conversation is always brilliant,
but on this occasion, I gather, he surpassed
himself. All eyes were fixed upon the handsome,
debonair visitant from an older world
of romance; for O’Hagan is at heart a
Musketeer. Moira Cumberley in particular
found him wholly entrancing; and each
glance of her bright eyes which rested upon
the cavalierly figure, likewise poured gall
and wormwood into two souls. One of these
souls was the sombre soul of Repton; the
other was the joyous but hungry soul of a
certain Mr. Bruce McIvor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“I could see how the wind blew,” O’Hagan
will explain. “McIvor was the favoured
swain, and naturally enough; for he was a
fine lad and descended from Robert Bruce.
When, later in the evening, I was presented
to Mrs. Cumberley—Moira’s mother—I discovered
the fly in the ointment. Repton
had money—but no blood, my boy; no
family—and poor McIvor, though he could
trace back to Bruce, was a mere free-lance
journalist. Mrs. Cumberley also lacked
breed, but worshipped Pluto. She had
banned the McIvor and encouraged Repton.
I saw my course plainly.”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>When my friend Bernard O’Hagan sees
his course plainly, there are squalls a-brewing
for any unhappy wight who queries the Captain’s
navigation.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk2-3'><span style='font-size:x-large'>III.</span><br/> NATURAL SELECTION.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Moira</span> sat out a dance with O’Hagan in the
conservatory. Needless to say, the Captain
does not dance. McIvor’s sighful acknowledgment
of the girl’s disappearance rose
above the music. Repton’s Mephistophelian
glare pierced palm and fern. But Moira
blushed, and settled down <span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear little girl,” said O’Hagan
blandly, “you are so very pretty and
charming, that I am going to talk to you
seriously about your lovers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moira gasped as the amazing Captain took
her hand and patted it paternally. Without
preamble he had placed the conversation
upon a thrilling level. It was a unique
experience, but she rather liked it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, I sincerely hope you do not care
for Mr. Repton,” continued O’Hagan;
“because late to-night or early to-morrow
morning I propose to pull his nose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” said Moira. But the language of
her eloquent eyes added: “Do him good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has asked you to marry him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(A rebellious glance).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(Slight nod).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have not yet given him your
answer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(Head-shake).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad of that; because I want you
to marry Bruce McIvor,” explained O’Hagan
judicially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!” snapped Moira, with a mutinous
shrug of pretty shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said O’Hagan. “I will tell you
why. He is a handsome, fine man, and one
of a brave and ancient race. He loves you
in a way altogether different from Repton’s
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has he told you so?”—frigidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I have not had an opportunity to
speak to him yet! But it is so. With the
stimulus of your affection, Moira, with the
chance of such a prize as you, he will go far.
I understand men of family, my dear, and I
tell you that Bruce is a splendid fellow.
As for you, Moira, I can only say that I
should like to marry you, myself! But since
that is impossible, I want it to be Bruce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was curiously impersonal; a kind of
directing Beneficence which from an Olympic
height smoothed the tangled skeins of lesser
lives. But there was a finality in his
pronouncements against whose thrall the girl
fought stubbornly with all the armoury of
her woman-soul. For another than Bernard
O’Hagan thus to have championed McIvor
must have spelled ruin for McIvor’s cause;
but if O’Hagan had been pressing the suit
of an unknown, and not that of one towards
whom the girl was predisposed favourably,
his advocacy must have told. Moira experienced
a sense of weakness; later, of
absolute futility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once submit to the yoke of O’Hagan’s
regal patronage, and you are lost. You
become a mere pawn. His majestic interference
is a stupendous force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Repton appeared to claim a dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Muffled thunder seemed to be called for
and a little incidental music in the form of a
sustained chord in G minor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been having a chat with Moira,
sir,” said O’Hagan, haughtily, rising as
Repton entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The muscles of Repton’s jaws stood out,
lumpish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have decided,” continued the cool
voice, “that your suit must be withdrawn!
It is distasteful to Moira—and distasteful to
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repton’s face, in the dimness, showed a
greyish white. He swallowed noisily—and
took a step towards Captain O’Hagan. Moira
clutched at the Captain’s arm. She did
not fully realise what had happened. Only
she knew that this strange man, who half
fascinated and half frightened her, had precipitated
a climax in her life; had, from no
personal motive that she could fathom—unless
antipathy from Repton and friendliness
to a descendant of Bruce—brought her
love affairs violently to a head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Resentment found place in her heart.
Captain O’Hagan was a mere chance acquaintance.
Yet—wondrous, expansively human
O’Hagan!—she gladly sank her individuality
in the overflowing lake of his own and was
not philosopher enough to know the source
of her contentment. Repton had been very
attentive, had spent his money lavishly, but
he had been more exacting than his position
warranted. What a pity that Bruce was so
poor!</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the world (so Moira’s mother taught)
was ruled by a gilded Providence with a rod
of iron: a rod of iron tipped with a magical
talisman—a bright new sovereign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Repton achieved speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it—true .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what this .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ruffian
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. says?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I note that you call me a ruffian, sir,”
said O’Hagan icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moira Cumberley was trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am—awfully sorry,” she answered,
speaking with difficulty, “that this has
come about. Don’t think I want to be bad
friends, Mr. Repton. I want us to be
friends always. But——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She cannot entertain marriage with a
man whose nose I shall pull in the morning!”
concluded O’Hagan. “I have other plans
for her future. Your card, sir—and you
may go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is there another living could have framed
such a speech?—another who could have
carried such a situation in such a manner?
I challenge you to produce him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repton turned on his heel. Of words he
was bereft again; action was impossible.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk2-4'><span style='font-size:x-large'>IV.</span><br/> AT FIG TREE COURT.<br/> I.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Captain O’Hagan</span> entered my rooms whilst
I was at breakfast—hatless, as is his custom;
debonair, as he cannot fail to be. His presence
has the curious effect of changing relative
values. His individuality absorbs: one can
no longer describe the scene: the scene is
Captain O’Hagan. As he lounges upon the
blue Chesterfield, with that odd pose of the
hip which suggests that a rapier swings
there, I often think that had he flourished
contemporaneously with Velasquez he had
surely inspired the artist to a supreme
achievement. “Portrait of the Chevalier
Bernard O’Hagan,” must have been counted
the Spanish master’s <span class='it'>chef d’œuvre</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Raymond, are you acquainted
with a person of the name of Repton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sidney Repton, company promoter, newspaper
proprietor, and so forth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be the fellow! He gave me
the slip last night! My position, as a
guest, precluded the possibility of obtaining
his address from another guest; and
the fellow left without his hat. But his
address was not in his hat. Where does he
live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“39<span style='font-size:smaller'>A</span>, Fig Tree Court.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come around with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For what, purpose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to pull his nose!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will probably prosecute you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think not. But I am entirely at his
service. And what about Bruce McIvor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“McIvor is a man of great promise. He
has been unfortunate. He would make an
ideal leader-writer. But he lacks the necessary
influence to secure such a post.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan frowned thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He lacks incentive, Raymond,” he said.
“A man who can trace his ancestry to Robert
Bruce requires no influence other than that
of blood. Blood, my boy! that is the
secret of success! When he is engaged to
the girl he loves—the girl I have chosen for
him—he will go far. Mark my words, Raymond;
he will go far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was unaware that he was a friend of
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never spoken to him! But it is
unnecessary. A leader-writer, you say? On
behalf of an old-established and soundly
Conservative organ, of course? Such vacancies,
I take it, are rare?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very rare. The leader-writer of the
<span class='it'>Universe</span> is about to become editor. That
will create a vacancy. But poor McIvor is
not in the running.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well—your friend, Repton, is a big
shareholder—managing director. And Repton—for
some reason—is no friend to McIvor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The reason is evident to me, Raymond.
But I am wasting time. I shall be too late
to pull Repton’s nose; and, owing to other
engagements, the pleasure would have to be
unduly postponed if I missed him this morning.
Are you ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear fellow, you really must excuse
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan rose, picked up his cane as though
it were a sword, swung his shoulders as
though to adjust a bandolier, and sighed
sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am disappointed in you, Raymond.
Your ancestor, who helped to hold Limerick,
would be disappointed in you, too, I fear.
You are tainted with the modern heresies
which substitute the solicitor for the second,
the divorce-court for the rapier. Good morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dignified displeasure of the Hon.
Bernard O’Hagan is a dire penalty for any
man to incur. The Captain retired from
my rooms as who should say, “There is a
plebeian strain somewhere here!” It was
a Charles rebuking a Buckingham; save that
the Buckingham was a sorry Villiers, and
the Charles a credit to the house of Stuart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving me to my breakfast and my
humiliation, proceed with O’Hagan to No.
39<span style='font-size:smaller'>A</span>, Fig Tree Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His loud and long ring upon the bell of
Repton’s chambers brought that monied and
harried bachelor in person to the door.
Repton wore slippers and a dressing-gown.
His pale, blonde face faded a tone upon
recognition of his early caller. Some dread
there was, mingled with the anger of a man
used to the servility which Talent accords to
Capital; for the calmly persistent and
imperious truculence of Captain O’Hagan
is awesome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan extended his arm and seized
Repton’s prominent nose in a vice-grip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uttering a furious imprecation, Sidney
Repton struck out at him. But a pupil of
Shashu Myuku (Grand Master of the Higher
Jiu-jitsu) is elusive as a marsh-light. There
are not six Europeans, my friend has assured
me, initiated in the occultry of Japanese
super-force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repton’s fists met vacancy. Obedient to
a power which, seemingly percolating from
his nose through every nerve of his body,
rendered him helpless—log-like—Repton
dropped, panting, to his knees. O’Hagan
thrust him prostrate, entered, and closed the
door behind him. The feat apparently was
performed effortless; such is the outstanding
wonder of this science (called, I believe,
<span class='it'>judo</span>).</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Police!” gasped the outraged man.
“Help! <span class='it'>Police!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” said O’Hagan sternly, “I should
not exploit these arts upon a gentleman.
But your whole conduct has shown me
plainly that you are not one. However, I
shall now resort to the ordinary methods
employed to chastise an offensive churl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He removed, a light grey glove (imbrued
with the blood of Repton), cast it contemptuously
from him; and, as Repton rose, clutching
the maltreated organ, O’Hagan grasped
his heavy cane with unmistakable intent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said O’Hagan, standing on the
threshold, “you will recall having referred
to me as an ‘overdressed puppy’! I have
yet to deal with you in regard to the offensive
terms ‘lunatic,’ ‘ruffian,’ and ‘confounded
policeman!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse you! I’ll kill you!” panted
Repton and crouched, looking up to O’Hagan
with glaring, malignant eyes which, at that
moment indeed, mirrored a murderous soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think not,” was the reply. “Others
have attempted the feat; but I am here
to-day, alive to resent insult.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other did not rise. Repton already
was defeated. The business-like ferocity of
O’Hagan, the absolute efficiency of his
methods, caused to evaporate what remained
of the quality vaguely labelled Courage,
leaving only the brine of bitter anger and
mortification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” he said slowly,
racking his muddled brains for a mode of
retribution which should not render him
ridiculous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood up and backed toward his desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remain where you are!” directed
O’Hagan, pointing his cane. “Attempt to
reach any weapon, and I shall thrash you
until I am tired!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am unarmed,” muttered Repton sullenly.
“You have a heavy stick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The situation was wildly bizarre—unlike
anything within his experience; of which he
had dreamed. The querulous voice did not
seem his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan placed his cane upon a chair, and
raised the monocle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you contemplate an attack?” he
asked, with a kind of pleased surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repton dropped into an armchair, and sank
his face in his hands. His inflamed nose
robbed the scene of a certain pathos which
otherwise had found place there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will sit at your desk,” said O’Hagan,
“and write a note to the new editor of the
<span class='it'>Universe</span> informing him that Mr. Bruce
McIvor will be his leader-writer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repton was galvanised. He started up;
clutched the chair-arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not! Your damned interference
in my affairs——” His voice broke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well.” O’Hagan took up his
cane. “The alternative is equally pleasing
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here!” Repton was on his feet
again, hands twitching. “I’ve got no chance
with you! You’re a bully!——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I warn you that I regard those words as
a new insult. Indeed, that is the greatest
insult of all. Should you term one a bully
who sued you for slander?” O’Hagan’s
eyes were bright. “Learn, that when you
insult a gentleman, the choice of weapons is
his! The law is a weapon for those who
cannot fight their own battles, not for such
as I!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah! what would you have given to have
heard him deliver that speech? But you
cannot even picture him, head aloft, foot
advanced; hear the ringing voice; quail
before the flashing eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repton wrote.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, a letter to McIvor, giving him the
appointment at the same salary as his predecessor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repton grasped at the desk. The ferrule
of O’Hagan’s cane tapped upon the writing-pad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the same salary as his predecessor, Mr.
Repton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The note was written.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ring up all your fellow-directors, or all
whom you can,” ordered the Captain, “and
tell them of this appointment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repton hesitated. To comply was to burn
his boats. The cane quivered in O’Hagan’s
nervous grasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s irregular. It may be annulled at
Wednesday’s meeting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it is annulled I shall thrash you in
public, when and where I next meet you.
You will be at liberty to take what steps
you please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lifting the receiver from the hook, Sidney
Repton made several calls, briefly communicating
to those who ruled the <span class='it'>Universe</span>
that Mr. Bruce McIvor was a desirable
acquisition to the literary staff. He was
vanquished. In aught save exact compliance
he saw ridicule—the contempt of Fleet
Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to O’Hagan, pale faced, eyes
flaming. Words trembled unspoken upon
his tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan spoke the word imperiously, and
raised his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have bought immunity,” he continued,
“in respect of your insults from
‘overdressed puppy’ to ‘bully.’ Any you
may utter henceforward I shall deal with
separately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He strode toward the door; turned in
a flash .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and struck a revolver out of
Repton’s hand. Stooping, he picked it from
the carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall consider my action in the matter
of this murderous assault, Mr. Repton,”
he said icily. “My behaviour will largely
depend upon your own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He slipped the weapon into his pocket, and
turned again. The door slammed behind
him.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'> <br/> II.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>We</span> caught Bruce McIvor just as he was
about to go out. I think I have never seen
a man quite so blankly amazed as he when
the letter of appointment was placed in his
hand. I am more or less accustomed to the
various emotions expressed by the victims
of O’Hagan’s extraordinary philanthropy;
but McIvor was positively alarming. He
seemed to be dazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I think he experienced that kind of sentiment
which makes a Frenchman weep, intoxicates
an Irishman, but chokes a Scotsman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the cab which O’Hagan had in waiting
we were a silent trio. O’Hagan leant back
humming a gay melody, whilst McIvor sat
watching him as if he half expected him to
vanish like some Arabian <span class='it'>ginn</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into a charming little villa we filed. McIvor’s
nervousness was appalling. He kept
close to my distinguished friend, and hung
upon his words as though in them alone he
hoped for salvation. In a pretty, <span class='it'>petite</span>
drawing-room we waited; the young Scot,
seated on the edge of a chair, looking like a
man on trial for murder; I hard put to it
to preserve a serene countenance; and
O’Hagan wandering from picture to picture,
and surveying each through his uplifted
monocle with the critical gaze of a connoisseur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he turned the glass upon the door,
drawing himself up with inimitable grandeur</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entered a very pretty girl, and a very
prim lady, more mature; excellently but
dryly, preserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McIvor rose and coughed and looked everywhere
but straight before him. The pretty
girl blushed frantically. The other lady
stared, extending her hand to O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan bowed. O’Hagan’s bow is a
notable event.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His neat introductory speech ended with
something to the effect that——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friend, Mr. Lawrence Raymond, would
like to be counted among <span class='it'>your</span> friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was acknowledged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am delighted, Miss Cumberley,” he
continued, linking his arm in that of McIvor
and drawing him forward, “to present to
you the new leader-writer of the <span class='it'>Universe</span>.
Mrs. Cumberley—your future son-in-law.
Congratulations!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can you picture the scene? I think not.
Heavens! what a man! I take off my hat to
Bernard O’Hagan.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk3-1'><span style='font-size:x-large'>I.</span><br/> THE BOOM-MAKER.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>My</span> friend Captain O’Hagan frequently is
misunderstood; his studied singularity of
appearance is falsely ascribed to a desire
for notoriety. Whereas he eschews and
abominates publicity of any kind, and merely
seeks to establish a visible distinction betwixt
the aristocrat and the plebeian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ever-increasing facilities for airing
one’s grievances in long primer, he contends,
are destructive of that chaste reserve once
characteristic of our race. I agree with
O’Hagan. He declares that we love to be
interviewed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it not true, Raymond,” he cries,
“that for the sake of seeing her photograph
(retouched) in the columns of a daily paper,
Mrs. Brown-Jones will reveal to the blushing
public the secret of her corsets? Does she
not draw attention to the graceful contour
of her form, and she (the mother of a family)
take the man in the street into her confidence,
imparting to him intimate particulars respecting
her wardrobe which, if used indiscreetly,
would prove most compromising?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, O’Hagan,” I reply, “it is so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He throws himself back in his chair, purple-lined
cloak widely flying; picturesque, hatless
head raised in scorn. He is the focus
of a hundred gazes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A young lady,” he continues, “whom
one might assume from her picture in the
advertisement column to be not wholly
destitute of modesty, will inform edified
readers that ‘until Mrs. Hodge brought me
a box of Nippo Ointment my face was one
red mass of pimples!’ She will declare that
formerly she was unable to sleep at night
owing to the itching of her back!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His scorn is terrible; superbly fearful.
Advertisement is anathema.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are seated in the Park, wherein at the
moment no one else is talked of but my
distinguished friend. Those who have the
honour of his acquaintance acquire a new
popularity with the less fortunate. Several
countesses and a charming duchess have
repassed us no fewer than nine times. But
O’Hagan, serenely insensible to the admiration
which he excites in so many bosoms,
lounges regally aloof, as one upon a lofty
minaret who scarce glances down to the
throngs beneath him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An author of “costume” romances passes.
His studiously cultivated resemblance to
Napoleon III. usually earns him a buzz of
acknowledgment. This morning he moves
amid the chill of unrecognition, and raises his
prominent moustache fiercely and rudely
as he glares at my companion, who usurps
all homage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fellow stares in an unwarrantable
manner,” says O’Hagan; and taking my
arm, he proceeds in the same direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We overtake the author, despite my
lagging footsteps; for I perceive that my
friend is bent upon some extravagant
act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author turns, glaring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But are you connected with the house of
Buonaparte?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author, puzzled, faintly gratified:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not directly, sir. But what——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I regret that, sir. I cherish an antipathy
from the family which I may term
hereditary. Your reply deprives me of the
pleasure of trimming your <span class='it'>moustachios</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man is stricken speechless. It is such
an encounter as he has portrayed (on paper) a
score of times. But in the actuality it finds
him lacking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For your whole appearance is most distasteful
to me,” concludes the Captain.
“Good morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(We proceed.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>A trembling voice which says something
about “a letter from my solicitor,” reaches
our ears, faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The solicitor again, Raymond!” laughs
O’Hagan. “Never the friend to measure
the length of one’s blade! Your knights of
the pen make sorry cavaliers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I grant it. And the worst of my bad
dreams is that wherein—unaccompanied by
the magnificent and terrible O’Hagan—I
encounter some of those whom he has browbeaten
in my presence!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, as I think I already have stated,
O’Hagan sometimes is misunderstood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a certain club, of which O’Hagan is
not a member, my friend was introduced to
an American gentleman who proclaimed himself
a press agent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“I like Americans—real, full-blooded,
whole-hearted Americans,” O’Hagan has
told me. “I can even appreciate how, in
an American, commercial acumen and gentility
may be wedded. My great grand-uncle,
Edmond, distinguished himself, as
you remember, in the Civil War.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His great grand-uncle, Edmond, is a
favourite source of anecdote; but the impression
left upon my mind is that a more
truculent, bloodthirsty swashbuckler never
breathed God’s air.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very delighted to have met you,
Captain O’Hagan,” said the press agent,
whose name was Alex. Dewson. “I would
like to put up a proposition right now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan fumbled, impressively, for the
broad black ribbon upon which depends his
monocle. He raised the glass, and, holding
it at some little distance from his right eye,
surveyed the speaker. O’Hagan’s right eye,
magnified by the pebble, can show, on
occasions, as a large grey orb of intolerance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You interest me, Mr. Dewson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll interest you some more yet, sir!”
declared Dewson, with cheery confidence.
“It’s likely you’ll have heard of a little
author called Ronald Brandon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke the words waggishly; as one
might say: “You may have heard a little
Stratford fellow, called Shakespeare, mentioned?”—or,
“You’ve perhaps seen the
name of a rather likely figure painter, known
as Michelangelo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In point of fact, Ronald Brandon really
<span class='it'>was</span> a “little” author; and, as it happened,
O’Hagan never had heard of him. He has
never heard of <span class='it'>any</span> modern fictionists; he
regards them <span class='it'>all</span> with immeasurable contempt.
Mr. Dewson’s question was purely a rhetoric
question, however, and he proceeded without
pausing for a reply:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His new book (it’ll break all the windows)
is ‘Jules Sanquin, Duellist.’ He’s placed
his press work in my hands, and I’ve been
looking for an introduction to you, Captain,
for over a week! I can put up a proposition
to net you a pile!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!” said O’Hagan, icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“Such people as Dewson,” he has confided
to me, “are calculated to bring disgrace upon
a national character. He was the type of
man who would have sought an audience
with His Holiness the Pope, and ‘put up a
proposition’ to boom St. Peter’s.”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My client, as you’ll know,” continued
the irrepressible press agent, “is top-hole
as a swordsman. Took out the team a year
ago that beat the Frenchmen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They tell me <span class='it'>you’re</span> pretty handy,”
resumed Dewson; “so here’s the goods in a
nutshell: I’ll send down a shorthand-typist
to your chambers to take a few notes;
put a sound man to work; and in a week
or a fortnight ‘My Affaires of Honour and
Gallantry, by Captain the Hon. Bernard
O’Hagan,’ will be in the press! I can promise
you an <span class='it'>advance</span> of £500, my dear sir! Meanwhile,
you insult Brandon, and meet him with
rapiers on the French coast—press, cinema
men, etc., in attendance. Out comes ‘Jules
Sanquin, Duellist’—five editions subscribed.
Out comes ‘My Affaires of Honour and Gallantry’—libraries
gasping! How d’you like
the title? <span class='it'>Affaires</span>—see? French. Get the
literary flavour right on the cover! How
d’you like the proposition?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The intolerant grey eye scrutinized the
brogues upon Mr. Dewson’s feet and rose
by gradations to the Stetson felt adorning
the apex of his commercial brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this delightful scheme a child of your
own fecundity, Mr. Dewson, or has Mr.
Ronald Brandon any share in its parentage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m out raising no man’s laurel wreaths,”
declared Dewson. “The proposition’s
Brandon’s. How does it appeal to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That portion of the ‘proposition,’ ” said
O’Hagan, with frigid courtesy, “which has
reference to a meeting on the French coast
appeals to me keenly!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk3-2'><span style='font-size:x-large'>II.</span><br/> LA BELLE LOTUS.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Those</span> of you who have the privilege to be
acquainted with my friend Bernard O’Hagan
will find much scope for wonderment in the
circumstance that Mr. Dewson proceeded
thus far and survived, intact. No one but
a successful press agent could possibly have
mistaken the significance of the Captain’s icy
calm. Anyone who, knowing him, had
adventured upon such a proposal, must have
been aware that, so doing, he carried his
life in his hand. Mr. Dewson remained
placidly ignorant of the fires which he was
coaling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come along now to Brandon’s
flat?” he suggested, in his brisk way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will afford me great pleasure. I am
most anxious to meet Mr. Brandon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing over the short journey, then—throughout
which almost every word of Mr.
Dewson’s inspired O’Hagan with a new wonder
at the shamelessness of the times, and
added fuel to his resentment—enter the house
of Ronald Brandon, novelist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here he is, Brandon!” cried the press
agent. “He’s coming in on it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ronald Brandon was a tall and good-looking
young man, carrying a certain
athletic arrogance with poor grace. From
his perfectly groomed fair hair to his white
spatted, immaculately glossy boots he was
an incarnate error of judgment. He had been
encouraged to think himself a celebrity—and
the whole thing was a mistake. He was
not even in the same flight with the double
of Napoleon III.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His casually extended hand Captain
O’Hagan failed to observe. O’Hagan bowed
with exceeding fine formality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going to have a little bout with me,
Captain?” laughed Brandon lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am looking forward to it,” was the
reply, “provided your status admits of my
crossing swords with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dewson and Brandon stared uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean, are you of gentle blood? To
what Brandons do you belong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The novelist continued to stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My governor is James Brandon, K.C.,
if that’s what you’re driving at!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Professional people?” said O’Hagan
with exquisite condescension. “Never mind.
For our present purpose, sufficiently respectable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What the now incensed Brandon might
have said to that will never be known, for
he was interrupted by the ringing of the bell,
by the almost immediate entrance of a loudly
pretty woman who was furiously overdressed,
who struck the vision a sharp blow, from
which one’s outraged eyes blinkingly recoiled.
She was arrayed in a long coat of leopard’s
skin, wore a motor bonnet of the same
material, from the left side whereof, rearward,
swept a golden plume of incredible length.
Her hair was of the hue sometimes called
Titian, but would have made Titian weep
blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This lady—who proved to be French—was
introduced as La Belle Lotus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another client of mine, Captain!” explained
Dewson, affably anxious to dissipate
the thundery atmosphere which had settled
upon the establishment. Brandon was
scowling ferociously. “She is the latest
sensation in dancers, sir. Her ‘Dance of
Delilah’ is the talk of London! This is the
lady you’ll quarrel about. Savvy? Three
birds with one stone! All town will rush
to see the girl two big men have fought over.
Up go her bookings! How’s that for a
three-handed boost? The limit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan raised his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It strikes me as being appreciably beyond
the limit!” he drawled. “But what has
led you to suppose that I am desirous of
publishing my memoirs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not out throwing away thousands,
I take it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the contrary, Mr. Dewson. But,
emphatically, I shall not publish any kind of
book. You may omit that item from your
‘proposition.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>La Belle surveyed the speaker appreciatively.
Brandon watched him in angry
perplexity. Dewson’s round eyes grew
rounder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean to say——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no intention of disturbing your
admirable arrangements, Mr. Dewson. You
may rely upon me to meet Mr. Brandon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But ‘My Affaires’ ”——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dismiss the idea. It is out of the
question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what are you doing it for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, having examined minutely the
visible attractions of La Belle Lotus—so
minutely as to make her blush—dropped
his glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your proposal is of such a nature,
sir,” he replied calmly, “that no gentleman
could decline to accept it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to know how we stand,” burst
in Brandon, his choler enhanced by the
evident inability of the lady to withstand
O’Hagan’s frank gaze. “Are you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I going to meet you on the
French coast, sir?” O’Hagan anticipated.
“Emphatically, yes! Rely upon me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s good,” rapped Dewson. “We’ll
talk about the book, later. When you see
eye to eye with me you won’t want to
drop it. But you’re game for the little
passage of arms? That’s the talk! Well,
talking’s dry work. What about——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me.” O’Hagan raised his hand.
“Pray excuse me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we’ve made no arrangements.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am listening, Mr. Dewson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dewson felt that he was being hustled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’d planned it to start on Wednesday
night. Brandon and Yvette—La Belle—are
having supper at Varano’s. I’m there,
too; but not at the same table. Press boys
there, of course. You blow in, and say or do
something which Brandon’s supposed to
take as an insult.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, his head attentively tilted,
nodded. La Belle was watching him, now,
fascinatedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall observe your wishes implicitly,
Mr. Dewson!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bit of a scene. Cards exchanged. Pars
in the press.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A proviso, sir. My name shall not be
mentioned.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not mentioned!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let all the credit be Mr. Brandon’s. I
remain anonymous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s sure to come out later. I don’t
understand——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am aware of that, Mr. Dewson! On
the following morning, if I do not mistake
you, Mr. Brandon’s friends call upon me, and
the meeting is arranged?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it! We’re supposed to be hushing
it up, see? But it kind of leaks out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Precisely. At what hour will Mr. Brandon
be supping?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say half-past eleven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is an appointment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan bowed to the leopard
lady, looking challengingly into her eyes—turned
from Messrs. Brandon and Dewson,
and walked to the door. Upon Brandon’s
tongue unutterable things trembled. Mr.
Dewson was not entirely at his ease.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk3-3'><span style='font-size:x-large'>III.</span><br/> THE BOOM.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Captain O’Hagan</span> entered Varano’s at half-past
eleven on Wednesday evening. No
more need be said. A sensation amongst the
guests is understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he paused, glass raised.
His pose was a poem in grace; his mode of
surveying those who supped was a tribute
so deliciously keen as almost to be insulting.
He focussed the table whereat Ronald
Brandon and the dancer were seated. Amid
a cathedral silence, impressive and oppressive,
he traversed the supper-room. To say that
he crossed it would be inaccurate and inadequate;
he traversed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir!”—he bent over Brandon—“one
moment. Mademoiselle!”—he smiled upon
La Belle Yvette—“might I entreat you to
step aside with me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced at Brandon, flushing with
excitement now that the moment of the
“boom” was come. Brandon, who vainly
had besought Dewson to recast the comedy—omitting
O’Hagan—examined his finger nails.
He was acting poorly. In fact he was pronouncedly
“fluffy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>La Belle rose and stepped aside with
O’Hagan. She wore an amazingly daring
and dazzlingly brilliant evening toilette; a
tight-fitting silk gown coloured in imitation
of a leopard’s skin. Dewson identified his
clients with certain “make-ups” or trademarks.
Thus, La Belle Lotus was “the
leopard lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Imagine every eye in Varano’s supper-room
to be centred upon this wildly picturesque
pair. O’Hagan, his cloak cast back in purple
splendour, rested one hand upon his hip
with a gesture which had not been inconsistent
with the act of depressing a rapier
hilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you quite sure”—he bent towards
her with inimitable gallantry—“that a scene
here will enhance your professional reputation?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced up rapidly—and down again,
shyly. She could not recall having feared
to meet any man’s eye prior to encountering
Captain O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Dewson—he says so; and Mr.
Dewson is so clever. He never makes mistakes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I concede that Mr. Dewson is clever;
but nevertheless he makes mistakes, mademoiselle.
I am impartial. I can insult
Mr. Brandon without involving you in any
way. But, if you wish to be involved,
command me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>La Belle felt singularly helpless. Instinctively
she divined that the forceful Mr.
Dewson and the imperious Captain O’Hagan
were advancing to no common end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is better that we keep to Mr. Dewson’s
arrangements, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan proffered his arm. He led her
doorward. A sibilant chorus of gasps arose.
Brandon was up, now. His face flushed
deeply, and paled, vying in its pallor with
the serviette which he crushed in one shaking
hand. He thrust back his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A staccato cough drew his gaze to a distant
table. Mr. Dewson—conscientious stage-manager—feared
that one of the cast was
like to overact his rôle. Brandon hesitated,
fuming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>La Belle Yvette knew a fearful joy. Her
inordinate vanity was gratified by this scene,
but even her great daring recoiled from that
which pended. Yet she offered no real
resistance. True, she placed her hand upon
O’Hagan’s, but he calmly clasped it in his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Act as I direct,” he said, bending his
picturesque head and looking into the half-fearful
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced aside to where the head-waiter
stood, a figure of pitiable indecision, a study
in fatuous ineptitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My man—this lady’s cloak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the hushed silence of the supper-room
the words rang out sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head-waiter hesitated. The head-waiter
at Varano’s is a person of proper proportions
and seemly dignity. It is no part
of his important functions menially to run
for hats and cloaks. O’Hagan’s unoccupied
hand raised the glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you aware that I gave you an
order?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head-waiter became aware of the
awesome fact. He departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brandon’s chair fell backward. A wine-glass
was dropped with a crash upon the floor
beside Mr. Dewson’s table. But the prompting
of the ingenious press agent now was
unheeded. The novelist strode down the
room. One or two of the male visitors half rose.
Some of the women began to look frightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn your impudence! Release that
lady!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dewson slipped from his place and joined
the interesting group. He placed his hand
warningly upon Brandon’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t lose your wool!” he whispered.
“It’s going great!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brandon shook him off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you hear me? Release that lady!
Yvette! stand aside, I beg of you! I have
something to say to this person!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>La Belle looked from face to face. All
was not well here. Only Captain O’Hagan
seemed at ease: he should be the star of her
guidance!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head-waiter returning, the Captain
assisted mademoiselle to endue her leopard-skin
cloak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brandon’s fists clenched and re-opened
convulsively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yvette!” He almost choked. “You
are not going <span class='it'>away</span>?—not going to leave me
here—a laughing-stock——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Ronald Brandon!” O’Hagan
placed his arm protectingly about mademoiselle’s
shoulders and stared through the
monocle at the novelist’s pale face. “I do
not approve of this lady’s being in your
company!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brandon fell back (O’Hagan’s divine
audacity can strike as a physical blow)
into the arms of Mr. Dewson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stick to your part!” hissed the
latter in his ear; and held him firmly.
“This is a treat! All the restaurant
heard what he said! Heard your name,
too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse you! Let go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The veins swelled upon Brandon’s forehead;
his eyes protruded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan, serenely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, mademoiselle! This vulgar
brawler is no fit companion for us!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half the guests were upon their feet now.
Someone had gone for the manager. The
horror-frozen head-waiter met the Gorgon
gaze which hypnotically sought him through
the pebble. He turned and swung wide the
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brandon made a savage leap. Dewson
grabbed his coat tails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mademoiselle, trembling slightly, having
quitted the room, O’Hagan turned, and tossed
his card at Brandon’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may care further to discuss the
matter at some future time,” he said coldly.
“I am otherwise engaged this evening!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brandon broke loose at that, but collided
with the head-waiter, who began to feel
faint. A tremendous buzz of conversation
arose. Above it sounded the shrill note of
a whistle. O’Hagan, without, had ordered a
taxi. Then someone laughed—a pressman
there for the “story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The novelist whisked around upon the
detaining Mr. Dewson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse you and your ‘boosts’!” he
snarled. “You’ve made me the laughing-stock
of London! I’ll kill that damned
O’Hagan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good business!” said the press agent.
“Do it. Double our sales!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk3-4'><span style='font-size:x-large'>IV.</span><br/> ECHOES OF THE BOOM.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>O’Hagan called</span> upon me. His entrances
possess electric properties. One’s schemes
melt; O’Hagan becomes the scheme of all
things terrestrial. The future shrinks,
bounded by O’Hagan. The universe is “a
universe after Captain the Hon. Bernard
O’Hagan.” An unexpected call by the
Tsar of all the Russias could not be more
exciting, and one would be less impressed if
the Mikado dropped in for a pipe and a
Scotch-and-soda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have selected you, Raymond”—he
toyed with his monocle—“to act for me in
a little affair on the French coast. You will
be associated with Lieutenant the Chevalier
Camille d’Oysans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was bad hearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Chevalier, according to O’Hagan, is
“the last of the <span class='it'>grand seigneurs</span>.” I think
O’Hagan may be right; and trust he is.
This fire-eating Frenchman in my opinion
constitutes a menace to society. He would
any day rather cut a man’s throat than
shake hands with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(His recent decoration for having personally
dispatched a larger number of Boches than
any other man in the armies of France,
will be a memory fresh in my reader’s mind.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I do not expect you to withdraw,
Raymond,”—coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since, on more than one recent occasion,
I had been so unfortunate as to incur
O’Hagan’s displeasure, I perceived that a
path was cut for my feet—a path of peril,
from which, nevertheless, I might not stray.
I understand that Charles II., when it pleased
him, could be a king indeed. The fact that
O’Hagan inherits a similar capacity from
someone or another is not necessarily destructive
of what posthumous reputation remains
to the lady of his race who ornamented the
Stuart court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed to me a press cutting. The
paragraph related how an anonymous gentleman
had had a public misunderstanding with
Mr. Ronald Brandon, the famous author,
whose forthcoming work, etc., etc. The
misunderstanding had been due to the
presence of La Belle Yvette Lotus, the
beautiful dancer, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’Oysans has already arranged the preliminaries,”
explained O’Hagan. “So all
that you have to do, my boy, is to meet me
at Victoria to-night at ten-thirty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is incredible!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall all stand to be arrested!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never fear. These little affairs are
better managed in France!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For heaven’s sake, what weapons?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Swords!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what way are you interested in this
girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In no way. Not in the slightest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan stood up and gracefully executed
the Grand Salute with his cane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I badly need a little practice,” he said.
“That is all, Raymond!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This man, Ronald Brandon, has some
reputation as a swordsman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I hear,” replied O’Hagan languidly.
“He has grossly insulted me; so that I
am quite looking forward to meeting him.
Although he merely comes of a race of attorneys,
he appears to have a fine reach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He yawned slightly. There came a ringing
of my door bell, which I proceeded to
investigate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might I inquire who the blazes your distinguished
visitor is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus O’Hagan, critically examining a very
large size in formidable ruffians who had
forced his way past me into the study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which of you is O’Hagan?” demanded
the caller, truculently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a man fully six feet two in his
boots; wore a peculiarly racy tweed suit,
cut morning-coat fashion; a pink soft collar,
and a green tie adorned with a big diamond.
He was bullet-headed, close shaven, and
rejoiced in a prominent jaw of marine blue.
He threw a soft hat into a corner and
addressed a ferocious glare to each of us in
turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a broken nose,” said the Captain,
with icy distaste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s done it! You’re ’im!” proclaimed
the visitor. “An’ you’ll ’ave a
broken neck in ’alf a mo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stripped off his coat and hurled it
amongst the litter of my writing-table. He
removed the diamond and placed it in his
waistcoat pocket. He tore his collar from his
ox-like neck and cast it on the carpet. He
began to unbutton his vest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is not a public bath,” said O’Hagan,
observing these manœuvres through his
monocle. “You can have a wash for twopence
at the lower end of Langham Place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other proceeded stolidly with his
immodest toilet, divesting himself of his
waistcoat and rolling up his sleeves over
his hirsute, brawny arms. No reply he made;
he was a man too full for words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan rose from the Chesterfield which
is his favourite lounge and stretched himself
languidly. He poked the fire and left the
poker between the bars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Raymond,” he drawled, “shall I go and
find a constable to throw this low dog down
stairs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man leapt to the door with extraordinary
agility, locked it, and slipped the
key into a back pocket of his trousers. He
faced us, a formidable figure, stripped to
the pink shirt, which revealed the enormous
development of his pectoral muscles. O’Hagan
moves amid singular proceedings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, my bonny gentleman! My name’s
‘Trooper’ Belcher—an’ I’m ’er husband!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust you refer to Mrs. Belcher?”—O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belcher: “My wife’s La Belle Lotus!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain studied Mr. Belcher with a
new curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I gather that you are a music-hall
pugilist. Am I also to conclude that you
are a bully acting on behalf of Mr. Brandon,
whom I have to meet at seven in the morning
outside Calais?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> met Mr. bloomin’ Brandon at seven
this evenin’ outside Oxford Circus!” shouted
Belcher. “<span class='it'>You’ll</span> meet ’im in Middlesex
’Ospital!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My wits had deserted me. From the
moment that the man had thrust his way
into my rooms up to that when he had thus
proclaimed himself the assailant of Brandon,
I had stood helplessly watching his outrageous
proceedings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“A gentleman, to-day,” O’Hagan has
informed me, “is utterly at the mercy of
the first lusty ruffian who cares to attack
him. The only offensive and defensive art
which survives to any extent—brutal
pugilism—is extensively practised among the
lower classes. Where is the gentleman’s
sword? Taken from him! The Higher Jiu-jitsu,
my dear Raymond, or Art of Gentle
Thought, should be included in the curriculum
of every preparatory establishment.”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belcher executed a charge which, I think,
would have swept a healthy bullock from its
feet. O’Hagan, with a lightning rapidity of
action apparently peculiar to pupils of
Shashu Myuku of Nagasaki, secured and
presented the poker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man touched it with one huge fist
and recoiled, screaming hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God! that’s ’ot!” he panted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” replied O’Hagan, again thrusting
the point amid the coals; “red hot!”
With his left hand he waved his monocle
in my direction. “One cannot soil one’s
hands with the persons of low fellows,
Raymond!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belcher snatched up a heavy chair as
though it had had no greater weight than a
matchbox. A lightning, rapier lunge with
the poker—an unpleasant <span class='it'>sizzling</span> sound—and
the chair crashed harmlessly to the
floor. The now painfully singed “trooper”
fell back on to the Chesterfield, groaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again my bell rang.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hand the key to Mr. Raymond, my
man,” ordered O’Hagan; “and replace your
filthy rags upon your indecently nude person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Belcher threw the key across the carpet.
My mind had assimilated a profound truth of
the Higher Jiu-Jitsu: brute courage falters
in the presence of hot pokers. I went to the
door, and upon the landing stood a dazzling
vision in leopard skins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My ’usband!” (The vision had a French
accent.) “Is he here? Yes? Quick!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slipped past me, as an animal growl
sounded from within. My rooms no longer
were my own, but were become a rendezvous
for insane meetings—for nightmare encounters.
I re-entered the bear-garden
which I had been wont to call my study.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leopard lady was kneeling beside the
wounded Mr. Belcher and explaining in
voluble syncopated English that his suspicions
were groundless, that it was a
“boom,” no more; that he must <span class='it'>not</span> kill
Captain O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My impression, Raymond,” said the
latter, focussing me across the room, “is
that our friend Belcher has recently left
jail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if I ’ave!” roared that maltreated
ruffian, starting to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” replied O’Hagan with suppressed
ferocity, “that if you are present in another
minute I shall send you back again!
<span class='it'>Madame!</span>”—he bowed to La Belle—“kindly
remove your property from my
friend’s apartment—I would suggest that you
deposit it in cold storage—and permit me
to say that I had credited you with nicer
taste!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He placed a cigarette between his lips,
igniting it with the now white-hot poker.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk3-5'><span style='font-size:x-large'>V.</span><br/> BELCHER THE THOROUGH.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>“It</span> is singularly illustrative of the obscure
psychology of the lower orders,” said
Bernard O’Hagan, “this marrying habit
of Continental music-hall artistes. The
female of the species may drive, take
supper, and accept diamonds from men of
pedigree; but she always marries a prize-fighter
or a bookmaker. It is a process of
natural selection, Raymond. When out of
the proceeds of a successful professional
career she invests in a husband, she ‘backs
her fancy.’ I have known Spanish dancers
who were adored by reigning monarchs
to have unsavoury husbands concealed in
all sorts of filthy alleys; and one lady circus
rider to whom I was presented in Budapest
proved to be lawfully wedded to a retired
Paris sewerman. Zoologically, the habit
has interest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our inquiries at the hospital discovered
Mr. Brandon to be on the danger list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most promising meeting since I
encountered Baron Verneux,” murmured
O’Hagan, “indefinitely postponed! The
Chevalier Camille d’Oysans will be keenly
disappointed. He had made all the necessary
arrangements for flying the country!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We learned that the police were in quest
of Mr. Brandon’s assailant. A call at Mr.
Alex. Dewson’s hotel provided a surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall not chastise him,” explained my
friend. “The depths of his ignorance are
pathetic. But I feel it to be my duty to tell
him that he is a disgrace to the great nation
which includes in its roll of honour the name
of Edmond O’Hagan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Dewson could receive no visitors.
Captain O’Hagan swept the servant aside
and waved to me to follow. It needs something
more than a verbal rebuff to exclude
O’Hagan—something in the nature of a
double-barred iron door or a squad with fixed
bayonets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My friend honoured Mr. Dewson’s apartment.
And Mr. Dewson, a heavily bandaged
figure hunched up in an armchair by the fire,
observed our intrusion with his one visible
eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Raymond,” said O’Hagan, as he focussed
this crippled apparition, “the ‘Trooper’
has forestalled us again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You bet he has, Captain!” whispered
a weak voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan turned to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the thoroughness of Mr. Belcher’s
method,” he said, “I find something almost
admirable, Raymond! The ‘Trooper’ is
a loss to the service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That he was a loss which speeding Time
should rectify, we, being but human, could
not foresee. But is it not history how
Sergeant Belcher, at a spot not a hundred
miles from Ypres, acquired the most coveted
distinction in the gift of His Britannic Majesty
for rescuing a badly wounded officer under
heavy fire? And is it not written in deathless annals
that the name of that gallant
officer was Captain the Hon. Bernard
O’Hagan, V.C., D.S.O.?</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>That</span> class distinctions are invidious, that
one man is as good as another, are theorems
which find no place in O’Hagan’s philosophy.
His whole life is a protest against such propositions.
He complains that there is no badge
peculiar to the gentleman; that the latest
morning-coat from Savile Row is colourably
imitated, and within a week, by Rye Lane,
Peckham. Hence, I take it, his broad, black
ribbon with the dependent monocle, his
purple-lined cloak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These things are not imitated, and for a
simple reason. O’Hagan’s cloak makes no
appeal to Peckham, and leaves even Hampstead
cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan holds that to tolerate scurrility
from the lower classes is to encourage rebellion,
and maintains that the French Revolution
was brought about, not by the vices of the
nobility, but by its weakness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spare the axe and spoil the people,”
he says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon the necessity for a sort of patrician
purple, distinctive of the gentleman, he is
insistent, and the episode illustrative of this
which he is fond of citing is that of the lonely
lady of the Strand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan, then, one evening, was
swinging westward along that thoroughfare,
hatless, as usual, in evening dress, with his
purple-lined cloak flying. Idle curiosity
induced him to stroll down that narrow,
sloping way which terminates in dungeonesque
darkness and arches, but which leads
one to the stage-door of the Novelty Theatre.
At the end of the passage upon which the
stage-door opens there may sometimes be
found sundry loafers. The inexperienced
might assume these to be connected with the
Novelty establishment, but would err in so
doing. They are connected with a much
older establishment; the ancient order of
Mouchers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As O’Hagan came abreast of this place,
the sole representative of the ancient order
on duty that evening, with a headshake, an
upward and a downward glance, and an evil
smile, dismissed the inquiry of a young lady
who, timidly, had addressed him, and
hastened to meet a party of three American
comedians as they descended from their
car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady, who was quite young, and simply
dressed in a dark walking habit, flushed with
mortification, and then became very pale
as she turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan’s blood boiled within his veins.
It is such a simple, everyday incident as
this which renders him really terrible. He
hastened after the lady, who was walking
slowly in the direction of Charing Cross,
and touched her gently upon the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame—your pardon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned, startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That fellow at the stage-door was rude
to you. I beg, as a favour, that you
will grant me permission to reprimand
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady, unmistakably, was displeased.
She was dark, and, as O’Hagan observed with
aesthetic appreciation, of a delicately aristocratic
beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mistaken. Pray do not trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“How,” O’Hagan will ask, “could she
be expected to know that a stranger addressing
her in the Strand was one in whose
discretion she might safely confide? To permit
any boor to endue a dress suit is to kill
chivalry.”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame, I beg that you will not misjudge
me. I am not mistaken, neither in
my surmise nor as to my plain duty. I do
not know your name, nor seek to learn it.
Mine is Captain O’Hagan. And had you been
a flower-seller I should as staunchly have
disputed my right to protect you from
insult as I do knowing you to be of my own
rank.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was bewildered. My friend is essentially
bewildering. He is not a person whom
any man or any woman can hope to snub—to
overlook. He comes into one’s life, a
tangible proposition, which cannot be
ignored; which, unavoidably, must be <span class='it'>dealt
with</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know you, sir. I really cannot
stand here conversing with a perfect stranger.”
Then, with a little, half-doubting glance up
to the fine eyes: “Are you one of the
O’Hagans of Dunnamore?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan bowed as no other man, though
you search the courts of Europe, can bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, Captain O’Hagan, since you are
a gentleman, please forget about the door-porter.
Believe me, I have troubles enough
without seeking new ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was pathos in the words, in her low,
quivering voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot doubt it. And, since you know
my family, you may know that its name
stands stainless for seven generations. You
should not be here, at this hour, alone. In
the absence of a father, of a brother, accept
my escort. It is in no way encumbent upon
you to accept my friendship, though it would
be devoted and disinterested.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was biting her lip now, in pathetic
perplexity; but there was a new confidence
in the glance which she gave him. It was
the glance of a woman who sorely lacked a
friend, and into whose heart the conviction
was stealing that heaven had sent her one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are more than kind, Captain
O’Hagan.” Now she met his eyes frankly.
Her decision was made. “I am—Lady
Brian Dillon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“You see, Raymond,” he has since
explained to me, “there was more than mere
chance in my unaccountable decision to
explore that passage. Fate, my boy—fate!”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the gloved hand which she offered
with a pretty embarrassment, and bent over
it in his unique, courtier fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never met your husband, Lady
Dillon. But his late father, Sir John, was one
of my dearest friends. I regard you, now,
as that dear friend’s daughter, and since
Fate has brought us both here to-night, I
regard your interests as a sacred charge.
You are in trouble. How can I serve
you?”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk4-2'><span style='font-size:x-large'>II.</span><br/> AT THE STAGE DOOR.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>I doubt</span> if London could furnish another
man—a father confessor excepted—who, in
so brief a time, could have learnt from the
young Lady Dillon so much of her history as
did O’Hagan. Side by side, they paced up
and down a comparatively quiet street dipping
riverward, and the girl (for she was no
more) confided in this man, whom, twenty
minutes earlier, she had not known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does not that argue eloquently for my
friend? Does it not make amends for much
that seems harsh in his nature? For although,
alas! women often are deceived in
men, a woman’s instincts can never err in
such case as this; a true woman, as this one,
never pours out the trouble with which her
heart is bursting, to a knave—to a blackguard.
I defy you to confute me. Be it
remembered that, by a trick of Fate—or shall
we say Providence?—these two had friends
in common. Nor be it forgot that, for
fifty miles north, south, east and west of
Dunnamore, “the honour of an O’Hagan”
is a form of oath. But, nevertheless, I maintain
that there is something grandly and
expansively human—something splendid and
true—in the nature of a man whom at such
brief acquaintance a good woman <span class='it'>knows</span> to be
worthy of her confidence. Don’t you agree
with me?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I remember your wedding!”
said O’Hagan. “Bless my soul! you were
a Miss Sheila Cavanagh! As a child you
must have been at Dunnamore many a time!
Why! we are quite old friends! You are
not married three months, yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten weeks,” replied Lady Dillon,
pathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And simply because your husband, Sir
Brian, saw you walking in St. James’s Park
with a gentleman——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has not spoken to me—for four
days!”—brokenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now he is waiting on the stage of
the Novelty for a Miss Betty Chatterton,
late of the Folly Theatre, whom formerly he
admired——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—He used to go about with her a lot,
I know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And this gentleman with whom you
were walking?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Dillon looked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said O’Hagan sadly, “you have
been indiscreet. He was an old admirer?”
(nod). “Persistent, unscrupulous?” (nod)—“and
you were sending this fellow about his
business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up to him as, of old, looked
Menippus Lycius to Apollonius of Tyana;
as to one omniscient—yet, crowning wonder,
as to a favourite brother. Such is the timbre
of my friend’s exquisite sympathy. Is it
not a divine gift?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you possibly know that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Lady Dillon—you have told
me! Does your husband know this
person?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knows <span class='it'>of</span> him. But he has never
even asked me his name. I thought he
understood that I did not care and never had
cared for the man. Oh! why did I see him?
Why did I see him? But I feared that,
unless I definitely dismissed him, he would
compromise me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor child!” He patted her arm,
soothingly. There are phases of his patronage
which are healing. One absorbs his
condescension gratefully, as a penitent receiving
absolution from a holy cardinal. “You
see, your marriage was a family arrangement,
and your husband is uncertain of your affections.
This regrettable incident has convinced
him—wrongly—that from your point
of view it is merely a <span class='it'>mariage de convenance</span>.
His flirtation is a harmless one. He is, I
dare swear, eating his heart out! But the
pride of the Dillons has him by the throat.
My dear little lady—leave him to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up to him wonderingly again;
but, with something of the touching confidence
of a child, permitted him to conduct her
Strandward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain O’Hagan! I could never,
never explain to him! That is why I dare
not speak! He would <span class='it'>never</span> forgive me
for seeing him again—would never understand——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave it entirely in my hands! <span class='it'>I</span> will
do the explaining! Simply accept my
explanation, and decline in any way to enlarge
upon it. You shall not be compromised,
because I know you do not deserve it.
Neither shall that hare-brained husband of
yours compromise another girl out of mere
<span class='it'>pique</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said nothing to that. In the Strand,
opposite the Novelty:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is your car yonder?” asked
O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! don’t let Priestman see me!”
cried Lady Dillon. “I was afraid he would
see me when I spoke to that wretch at the
door!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are perfectly certain that your husband
is in the theatre?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes! yes! I don’t know why I asked
that man! But, indeed, I don’t know
what possessed me at all! Oh! Captain
O’Hagan, I am so miserable!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boy!” said O’Hagan to a passing
urchin—“tell the chauffeur of the Rolls
Royce yonder, to pull around here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Off ran the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But——” began Lady Dillon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan patted her arm. The chauffeur,
having received the boy’s message, could
be seen looking in their direction. Presently
he walked across to where they stood. Recognising
Lady Dillon, he stared; then touched
his cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ordered you to bring the car over,”
said O’Hagan, icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Brian”——began the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you understand my words?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chauffeur ran back, and in a few
moments the big car was drawn up to the
kerb. O’Hagan placed Lady Dillon comfortably
in a cushioned corner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, dear Lady Dillon,” he said.
“I will bring Brian home to you very
shortly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her wondering, tearful eyes never left his
face. To the now deferential though badly
embarrassed man:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Home!” said O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Off moved the smoothly-running car.
Whilst she could see him where he stood,
Lady Dillon never took her eyes from the
tall, cloaked figure of this old friend of old
friends and one so newly found, of this
astonishing Samaritan who had promised
to restore to her the gladness of life. With
picturesque head bowed he waited until the
Rolls Royce was lost from view, one gloved
hand resting upon the heavy ebony cane,
the other, ungloved, dangling from two long
fingers the monocle dependent on its black
silk ribbon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a never-ending source of regret to me
that we have no Velasquez to-day. Captain
the Hon. Bernard O’Hagan would inspire
such an one to a great masterpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My friend returned to the narrow alley-way,
descended it, and stood before the unofficial
deputy for the baggage-man, whose treatment
of Lady Dillon had occasioned his just
resentment. In his dealings with such as
this, O’Hagan can be terrible. To him he
addressed no word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dropping his monocle, he seized the fellow
by the ear (with his gloved hand) and dragged
the agonised face closely to his own haughty
countenance. The feat was seemingly performed
effortless—such is the outstanding
wonder of that Judo, or Higher Jiu-jitsu,
whereof Shashu Myuku of Nagasaki is the
Grand Master. There are not six Europeans,
O’Hagan will tell you, who have been initiated
into the occultry of the Japanese super-force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You recently insulted a lady who inquired
if Sir Brian Dillon had entered the stage-door.
Down on your knees, you sot—and
beg for pardon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Obedient to a power which, seemingly
entering at the ear, proceeded thence through
every tortured nerve of his person, rendering
him helpless, inert, down dropped the big,
hulking figure. It chanced that none was
there to see. Yet the exhibition was an odd
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Repeat, after me, ‘I humbly beg,
sir——’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Police!” gasped the man, and strove
to get at O’Hagan with his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly he dropped them; his big face
grew livid. The Captain, holding the ear
in that vice-grip, had merely turned it slightly
backward. The man groaned; beads of
perspiration started on his brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Repeat, after me, ‘I humbly beg, sir,
for the lady’s pardon.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Faintly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I humbly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. beg, sir .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my
Gawd! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the lidy’s pardon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And abjectly entreat you to forgive me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. abjec .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. abjec’y entreat
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you to forgive .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The victim struggled erect. He met the
quelling gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any repetition of the offence means that
my man will wait upon you—and bring a
horse-whip!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fellow scrambled aside, and raised a
quivering hand to his forehead. Captain
O’Hagan, swinging his monocle, strode to
the stage-door.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk4-3'><span style='font-size:x-large'>III.</span><br/> IN THE DRESSING-ROOM.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>To</span> the stage door-keeper said O’Hagan:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has Miss Chatterton appeared yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she in her dressing-room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe so, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has she a private dressing-room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she dressed, yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She must be, sir. She finished over
half-an-hour ago, and a gentleman went up
some time since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What number is her room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Number Six, sir, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan placed half-a-crown upon
the window-ledge and stepped along the
passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, sir!” The man came running
from his box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan turned, glass raised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wished to speak to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you very much, sir, but I must
take your card through first, or——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Captain O’Hagan. I have
business with Miss Chatterton.”
He proceeded, unruffled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll get me into trouble, sir——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, over his shoulder:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I esteem your regard for duty, my man.
Rely upon me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was gone. The door-keeper scratched
his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ascending a flight of stone steps, the
Captain came to a landing, a door opening
upon it. The door was ajar and bore no
number, but voices might be heard proceeding
from the room beyond. O’Hagan rapped,
and opened the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several gentlemen, in several stages of
undress, all looked up from their several
toilettes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear I intrude,” said O’Hagan, holding
his monocle before his right eye and examining
the occupants of the apartment with a kind
of genial curiosity. “I wish to find room
number six.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next floor, second door,” volunteered a
young man in underwear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am indebted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan withdrew and proceeded upstairs.
Room six showed a closed door. O’Hagan
knocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’s there?” inquired a masculine
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A golden-headed lady, who was arranging
a rare exotic in hats upon her elaborate
coiffure, fixed wondering eyes upon the
intruder. A maid glanced up from where
she knelt beside a large basket; and a dark-haired,
perfectly groomed young man, of
military bearing, rose hurriedly from his seat
upon a second and even larger basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Chatterton, your pardon. Sir Brian
Dillon, I presume? Might I ask you, my
good girl”—to the staring maid—“to withdraw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held the door open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here, I say!” burst out Miss Chatterton.
“Who are you? What’s it all about——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am Captain O’Hagan. I have a family
matter to discuss with Sir Brian; and I wish
you, Miss Chatterton, to be present.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He waved his monocle towards the maid,
and then in the direction of the open door.
The girl stood up, looked at her mistress, but
saw her to be as helpless as herself; looked
at the forceful new arrival, and slowly went
out. O’Hagan closed the door. Two pairs
of wondering eyes followed his every movement.
My friend has a singular quality of
personality. I believe he could so enter the
House of Lords as to visit consternation upon
every peer present, and to set the bishops
reviewing their pasts with grave misgivings.
Bernard O’Hagan is a mannerist of genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Brian Dillon cleared his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I might venture on a remark,” he said,
with an angry gleam in his grey eyes, “what
do you want, and who the devil <span class='it'>are</span> you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan wound the black ribbon about his
right forefinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am the gentleman,” he replied, with
frigid distinctness, “whom you saw walking
with Lady Dillon in St. James’s Park some
days ago, and I am here to <span class='it'>demand</span> an explanation!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Have you sometimes, at a proper and
sombre social function, dreamed of what
would happen if some bold spirit rose up
and sang one of Mr. George Robey’s sprightliest
songs? Have you even contemplated,
in what I may term horrified delight, the
effect of a loudly uttered swear-word upon
a gathering of elders? This remark of
O’Hagan’s produced that sort of effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Chatterton slowly sank down into
an armchair, never removing her gaze from
the last speaker. Sir Brian’s eyes opened
wider and yet wider. He bit his lower lip—and
took a step forward. He halted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You</span>,” he began—and his tone was different
from that of his normal speech—“<span class='it'>you</span> are
here, to demand an explanation of <span class='it'>me</span>!
You admit that you are——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg,” O’Hagan interrupted him, “that
you will not refer to my statement as an
admission. I am proud of my name, and
proud of my friendship with your wife. You
have wronged her, and you wrong Miss
Chatterton. Particularly, you have wronged
<span class='it'>me</span>. It is for this—for your gross insult to
myself—that I am here to call you to
account!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dillon nearly choked; and his fingers
twitched convulsively. He believed, and
with a large and generous trust had sought
no word from his wife in aye or nay, that it
had been another than himself who first had
won her love. Later, he believed that his
trust had been misplaced, had been betrayed;
that the unknown who had played some
part, great or small, in her life before he,
Brian, came into it, was indeed lord of the
kingdom that he madly had thought his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the usurper stood before him, his
attitude neither apologetic nor explanatory—not
that of the offender but of the offended!
“—To call me to account!” echoed Dillon,
in a voice sunken almost to a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That form of words was the crowning
affront of all. It summoned into being the
primeval savage which dwells somewhere
within every man of Celtic stock. It was this
primitive being, whose tribal pride had
stifled relenting—denied the woman fair
speech and trial—and not the cultured
modern man, with whom O’Hagan was come
to deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty”—Dillon’s speech was thick as
that of a drunkard—“would you mind postponing
the supper?” He swallowed, dryly.
“I will see you—to the car. Forgive me, but
to-night——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>I</span> will see Miss Chatterton to a cab,”
interrupted O’Hagan’s icy voice. “I have
sent Lady Dillon home in the car. <span class='it'>You</span>
will await me here——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dillon clenched his fists: his nostrils
dilated. In that instant my friend came more
nearly to an unseemly embroilment than ever
in his surprising career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brian!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Betty Chatterton sprang to Dillon, clutching
his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Chatterton,” continued O’Hagan,
“I beg you to accept my escort. It will be
better if we go at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked from man to man, and grew pale
to the lips. Sir Brian glassily stared directly
at O’Hagan and ignored the hand that clung
to his rigid arm. The girl released her clasp
and turned imploring blue eyes upon the
Captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Captain O’Hagan,” she said, “there
is some dreadful mistake! If you think—ah!
how can I say what I mean? <span class='it'>Will</span> you
believe me”—she frankly met his gaze—“if
I tell you that Sir Brian and I are just
chums?” Her eyes were flooded with tears.
“He is awfully—dreadfully unhappy
about .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She laid her hand hesitatingly
upon O’Hagan’s arm. “I know you have
done him no wrong. Won’t you believe <span class='it'>me</span>,
too? Can’t we be friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“I had anticipated something altogether
more vulgar, Raymond,” O’Hagan recently
informed me. “I will confess that I was
surprised and delighted. Miss Chatterton
had the instincts of a lady and the generosity
of a gentleman! A really lovable nature,
my boy. That infernal ass deserved nothing
so fine as her friendship!”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Captain raised her hand to his lips,
bending over it with stately courtesy. Again
their eyes met—and these two understood
one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty,” began Dillon, advancing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay where you are, Brian,” she said,
with a sudden note of command. “You must
see that I don’t want to be mixed up in your
quarrels. And—Captain O’Hagan is right.
We cannot expect the world to understand us.
You shouldn’t have come here to-night.
No, I’m not angry with you, silly boy—but
it wasn’t fair to me. I can see that, now.
You had nearly made a big mistake, Brian.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held out her hand, firmly. Dillon
turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” she said, and shrugged her
shoulders. “You’ll know I was a real pal
one day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leant lightly upon O’Hagan’s arm;
and the two left the room. She smiled
bravely as they passed the stage door-keeper
and bade him cheerily good-night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“Gad, Raymond!” says O’Hagan, “that
girl was a brick; for she was every bit as
much in love with Dillon as Dillon was in
love with his wife!”)</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk4-4'><span style='font-size:x-large'>IV.</span><br/> THE SNOWS OF THE YUKON.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>O’Hagan, with</span> some research, recently established
the fact, in the case of Betty Chatterton,
that “there was good blood on the mother’s
side.” I fancy he slept better after that.
As a child of the people (I use my friend’s
phraseology) Miss Chatterton was a disturbing
element in the Captain’s philosophy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to the dressing-room. Let us
accompany him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the landing stood the maid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, sir,” said she, timidly, “may I
go in and finish packing the basket?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Presently, my good girl,” replied the Captain,
“presently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Brian Dillon was seated where O’Hagan
first had found him. He was smoking a cigarette.
His face was somewhat pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose, as the Captain entered, and very
deliberately threw the cigarette into the tiny
hearth. To any but a student of indications,
he must have appeared quite composed.
O’Hagan knew it to be otherwise. Yet he
was unprepared for Dillon’s action. Dillon,
silently, leapt at him across the room!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I say he was unprepared. In a certain
sense he was. But, on the other hand, a
pupil of Myuku is never unprepared.
O’Hagan dropped his cane, instinctively (the
Higher Jiu-jitsu is essentially instinctive).
He grasped the fist which whizzed within
half an inch of his right ear, performing one
of those lightning movements unachievable
by any other man of my acquaintance. He
thrust it up. He twisted it to the right—down—and
doubled the arm behind Dillon’s
back. Daintily, he clasped the other wrist
and held the left arm inert, outstretched
at an angle of forty-five from his opponent’s
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, you may know, is a simple trick,
which can be performed, with luck, by several
members, individually, of the Metropolitan
and City Police forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dillon made one attempt to break away—and
then stood still, looking back across his
shoulder at O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God, I’ll kill you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something shocking in the
murderous intent which beaconed from his
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Later, you shall be afforded every opportunity.
But, first, you must hear me. Shall
I release you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No humiliation can equal that which it is
in the power of the expert Jiu-Jitsuist to
inflict. An enraged man, though he be outclassed,
overweighted, may fight to the last
and keep his pride. But this supreme inertia,
this being petrified, posed as for a ballroom
scene in a “living-picture,” with frenzied
anger boiling in the veins and no muscle
responding to the mind’s urgent commands,
is something that must be experienced fully
to be appreciated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dillon panted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I release you,” added O’Hagan icily,
“it will be upon parole; upon the understanding
that you conserve your resentment
for a more fitting time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Release me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Upon that understanding?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse you! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. <span class='it'>yes!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan dropped his hands, stepped back
to the little mantelpiece and leaned upon it,
raising his monocle before his right eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Brian Dillon,” he said deliberately,
“you may have heard my name; for I knew
your father well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other’s fingers twitched. He glared
directly at O’Hagan, and thrust his hands
deeply in his pockets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father would have known the gross
nature of your insult to me. Strong man as
you are, he would have forced you to apologise,
or have knocked you down. Do your
memories bear me out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dillon swallowed, emotionally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You add insult to the most awful injury
one man can inflict upon another——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” O’Hagan’s big eyes blazed. He
took a step forward. “Stop! By God, sir,
if you presume to cast such an innuendo in
my face I will break your neck, though I
hang for it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a species of subdued ferocity in
his manner that had forced conviction upon
anyone. No man born of woman could have
doubted him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You slander me. It is no excuse that
you do so, thinking I am he who died on the
Yukon border last March.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A puzzled expression mingled and conflicted
with the others which flitted across
Dillon’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since Sheila Cavanagh and I met at
Dunnamore Castle—a childish meeting which
your wife had forgotten—we never had set
eyes upon each other until that day in St.
James’s Park. Despite the passage of years,
I knew her again. How dare you—I repeat,
sir, how dare you presume to deny me the
privilege of your wife’s friendship!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dillon’s expression changed again—to one
of bewilderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” he gasped, “you are not——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan raised his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him rest in peace,” he said sternly.
“He was an honourable man, unfortunate in
love. You wrong him villainously. If she
had cared for him he would be alive to-day.
It was something very like suicide—and
therefore I charge you, Brian Dillon, never
to breathe a word of his unhappy end, never
to speak his name to your wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know his name. How do you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I buried him in the snow!” said Captain
O’Hagan with impressive finality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dillon dropped limply on to the big
property-basket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then Sheila never cared for him! And he
is dead! And it was you, an old friend, and
a friend of my father’s, whom——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been a villain to her!—a
villain to Miss Chatterton—doubly a villain
to me!——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Brian sprang up, his face boyish, bright
with a glad contrition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain O’Hagan!” he cried, “will you
take my hand? A hundred thousand times

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk5-1'><span style='font-size:x-large'>I.</span><br/> HAVERLEY OF THE GREYS.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>My</span> friend Captain O’Hagan is a man fatally
easy to misjudge; a man monstrously difficult
to appreciate. Arraign him before a bar
of his peers, and no two findings would march
in step, no two voices be in unison. If we
except the critic of the <span class='it'>Tailor and Cutter</span>,
I doubt, indeed, if there be a man in London
who perceives the exquisite distinction of
O’Hagan’s dress. His mode of going hatless
is dubbed affectation; his purple-lined cloak
an ostentatious extravagance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But some there are who instinctively detect
O’Hagan’s sterling qualities; some (as
myself) achieve to this knowledge; and some
have it thrust upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I recall an illustrative incident:</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan and I were at one of those pleasant
afternoon functions where the caller surreptitiously,
but constantly, glances at his timepiece
in order to learn if a sufficient interval
has elapsed since his arrival to admit of his
departure. You have been, no doubt?
O’Hagan rarely goes; but a Miss Pamela
Crichton was present on this occasion—and,
somehow, O’Hagan and I are frequently
meeting this charming girl at all sorts of odd
places—quite by accident, oh, quite by
accident.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am proud of the success which Pamela
has achieved,” my friend whispered to me,
“since I took her up.” (She composes).
“But I do not approve of her accepting these
social invitations. She is merely providing
the hostess with a gratuitous entertainment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This view of the matter, from O’Hagan,
surprised me. But later, the hostess said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Dear</span> Miss Crichton, you will play us that
last charming piece of yours, <span class='it'>won’t</span> you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pointzby-North’s request was sweetly
proffered, but it was a sweetness akin to that
with which, addressing a valued butler, she
might have said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Milton</span>, you will see that the bull-dogs
are not permitted to fight in the drawing-room
in future, <span class='it'>won’t</span> you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan did not object to the tone of
patronage, however. (“Mrs. Pointzby-North,”
said he, “is a member of a very old
and distinguished family.” That, of course,
was final.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when Pamela began to play, delightfully,
and everyone continued to chatter,
simianly, he stood up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rank has its obligations,” he said—and
strode across to the player.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took both her hands, and the flow of
melody ceased upon an unexpected discord.
Then came silence—the thrilling silence of
surprise. Lolling gracefully upon the baby
grand, my friend toyed with the black ribbon
upon which his monocle dangles and glanced
toward Mrs. Pointzby-North.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Mrs. North, as a very old and
quite absurdly privileged friend, might I
address a few words to everybody, without
annoyance to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pointzby-North, fluttering somewhat:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My <span class='it'>dear</span> Captain O’Hagan! As if you
<span class='it'>could</span> offend me, however hard you tried!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan inclined his head, and raised the
monocle to survey the expectant ring of
guests. Then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good folks, Miss Pamela Crichton is
so well worth listening to, that I beg you will
preserve a perfect quiet whilst she is playing.
Believe me, you will be well repaid, and will
furthermore confer upon Mrs. North and
upon myself a favour which we shall deeply
appreciate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pamela performed amid a throbbing silence
which would have gratified Sarah Bernhardt.
But I divined how in future the doors of Mrs.
Pointzby-North would be closed to Miss
Crichton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“It is better,” O’Hagan explained to me,
when we had seen the girl to a cab. “I do
not desire that Pamela be treated as a public
exhibit.”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Replace the famous cloak with a toga, and
in O’Hagan you have a very complete patrician—an
aristocrat of sensibilities so exquisite
that the trifling errors of good society jar upon
them more harshly than the eating of peas
with a knife upon the atrophied perceptions
of the merely respectable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner that evening Sir Roger Rundel
called upon O’Hagan in his chambers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My friend’s chambers overlook Whitehall,
and, in his moments of ease, he is always to
be found in the room which he calls his library,
but whose appointments more nearly correspond
with those of a harêm. To visitors
but superficially acquainted with O’Hagan,
this apartment proves a surprise. Its
arabesques dimly perceptible in the blue rays
of a hanging lamp, the plash of water in a
tiny marble basin enhancing the illusion that
one has lost one’s way, this <span class='it'>mandarah</span> possesses
all the charms of the unexpected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For golden carp in the basin you are of
course prepared? Prepare, further, for
O’Hagan in a loose blue robe, O’Hagan
extended upon a cushioned divan, sipping
coffee from a tiny porcelain cup and enjoying
the solace of tumbâk in a Persian narghli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donohue, a model man, immaculate, in
immaculate black, proclaimed the arrival,
and ushered in the person, of Sir Roger.
You would like Sir Roger Rundel; bronzed,
well groomed, reserved, forty-five; he is what
we mean by a typical English gentleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He and O’Hagan are old friends. Donohue
made fresh <span class='it'>kahweh</span> (no one expects
whisky in the <span class='it'>mandarah</span>), whilst Sir Roger
selected from the rack an amber mouthpiece
neatly labelled “R.R.” and appropriated
the guest’s tube of the narghli.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan: “Been hoping to see you every
day since I heard of your return, Rundel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Roger: “Yes, yes. Since my—marriage,
fear I’ve neglected bachelor
friends. I leave London to-night—on
departmental business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence; broken by bubbling of narghli.
Enter Donohue with coffee. Exit Donohue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan fumbled for the indispensable
pebble, found it, and examined Sir Roger’s
face critically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a fly in the ointment, Rundel.
Name the brute’s species.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Roger put down his cup with a rattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Haverley,” he snapped—“and
now I’ve said it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” mused O’Hagan; “Haverley, of
the —th Greys. Only know him by repute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort of repute?” growled Rundel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” O’Hagan nodded, and dropped his
monocle. “<span class='it'>That</span> sort!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir Roger got upon his feet, and began to
pace up and down a square of Persian carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know one another, O’Hagan.
There’s not another man in England I’d confide
in. But—well—Beesley told me about
this afternoon—at Mrs. Pointzby-North’s,
and I said, ‘Same old O’Hagan!’ That’s
what it is, O’Hagan: there’s only one of you—only
one of you! This—friendship—between
my wife and Haverley is nothing—from
Val’s point of view. Understand?
<span class='it'>She</span> means no harm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What attitude have you adopted?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No attitude. Overlooked it. But I’m
going away; and I will <span class='it'>not</span> have Val talked
about, and I will <span class='it'>not</span> be made to look
ridiculous. In a word, O’Hagan, I’ll have no
damned <span class='it'>cavalière servante</span> with Haverley’s
reputation dangling after my wife!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” said O’Hagan, calmly sipping
coffee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Val’s younger than me; and I don’t want
her to think that I think—see what I mean?
I can’t speak to <span class='it'>her</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I follow you perfectly,” said O’Hagan.
“You can speak to neither party without
the risk of precipitating what you wish to
avoid. Thanks for entrusting this matter
to me, Rundel. I will call out Captain
Haverley to-morrow morning!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear fellow! never do at all!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? I should see to it that he remained
incapacitated in France throughout
the term of your absence!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too medieval, O’Hagan—too dam’
medieval. Bar you the country for twelve
months at least! Besides, he might refuse—or,
worse, you might kill him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True,” agreed O’Hagan; “such mistakes
have occurred. However—if Captain
Haverley is not permitted the society of Lady
Rundel during your absence, I take it that
you will be satisfied?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly! certainly! If I knew that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rely upon it, Rundel,” said O’Hagan,
rising. “I will put an end to this undesirable
intimacy. I shall regard it as my sacred
duty to do so!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that moment he was superb; a man
worthy of the confidence of kings; a man to
hold stainless the honour of a queen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear fellow!” said Sir Roger, and
shook his hand furiously. “My dear, dear
fellow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ah! what a privilege it is to call Bernard
O’Hagan your friend!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk5-2'><span style='font-size:x-large'>II.</span><br/> ACCORDING TO MYUKU.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Captain Haverley</span> placed upon a table
beside him the card of Captain The Hon.
Bernard O’Hagan, V.C., D.S.O., as that
distinguished officer was shown in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I have heard of you, Captain
O’Hagan,” he said; “but this is our first
meeting, I think?” He glanced at his watch.
“Better late than never!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan bowed coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was about to refer to my calling upon
you at this late hour,” he explained; “but
since you have so rudely anticipated me, an
apology becomes unnecessary. I will merely
state my business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haverley, a blonde and arrogantly handsome
man at whose breast Eros aimed his
darts every time that he went into a drawing-room,
and at whose back fifty per cent, of
his company were sworn to aim their rifles
the first time that he went into action, believed
that he had misunderstood O’Hagan. But:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In short,” continued the latter, swinging
his monocle, “your friendship with Lady
Rundel must cease. It will be evident to
you that in her husband’s absence its continuance
would be compromising.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haverley knew, then, that he had heard
aright, and his face paled with an anger which
was intense; his hazel eyes seemed to emit
sparks; and he slowly moved nearer to this
adept in polished insult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain O’Hagan,” he said, distinctly—“the
door is immediately behind you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A matter of more pressing import,”
replied O’Hagan icily, “is immediately in
front of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With three swinging strides he crossed to
the mantelpiece. It was decorated with
several women’s photographs—among them,
one of Lady Rundel. Snatching it, framed
as it was, from its place, he broke it across
his knee and hurled the fragments into the
hearth!</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that, Haverley leapt. Calculating with
a boxer’s cunning the exact instant when his
man would turn, he launched a blow for the
angle of his jaw. The primitive, strong
within him, ruled now supreme. But
O’Hagan did <span class='it'>not</span> turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stepped back upon Haverley, and
stooped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is needless to quote the apposite precept
of Shashu Myuku of Nagasaki (Dean of the
College of Higher Jiu-jitsu) in order to make
clear what happened. Haverley performed
a complete somersault over O’Hagan’s arched
back and fell, heaped up, crashing in the
hearth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan stepped to the door,
and gained it as Haverley’s man hurriedly
entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You understand?” said O’Hagan. “I
forbid you this lady’s company. If you
dispute my right to do so, I shall expect your
friends in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haverley, choking, shaken, got upon his
feet. His white-faced man barred the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, sir .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan brushed him aside. He has a
sweeping motion of the left arm which would
remove a lifeguardsman from his path as
effectively as the flick of a handkerchief
brushes a fly from a bald head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man clutched at a buhl cabinet to
save himself. Upon a discordant finale of
smashing porcelain, intermingled with human
cursing, Captain O’Hagan made his exit
to the plaudit of the gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is a master of effective curtains.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk5-3'><span style='font-size:x-large'>III.</span><br/> INTRODUCING DONOHUE.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>I have</span> hinted, I think, that my friend
disapproves of many usages of modern
society. He maintains that it is in no sense
representative of the true aristocracy. (“I
have known a knight, Raymond,” he says
“who avoided eating water-melon because
it made his ears wet.”) This anecdote I
take to be more properly a parable; but it
serves to illustrate a phase of O’Hagan’s
character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have the feminine section of
society composed wholly of Cæsar’ wives.
How he reconciles this view with the career
of the fair O’Hagan who embellished a Stuart
Court held at Hampton, I am too diffident
to inquire though curious to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His espousal of the righteous cause of Sir
Roger Rundel was in every sense a love-match.
What advice should <span class='it'>you</span> have offered
to Sir Roger? At best your aid had ceased
with words, I dare to predict. But from the
first traceable O’Hagan (some kind of pirate,
I believe) to Bernard, the O’Hagans essentially
figure as men of action, often as not
of sanguinary action. We are agreed, then,
that you and I are not of the kidney properly
to conduct this affair? Your attention for
Captain Bernard O’Hagan!</p>

<p class='pindent'>No communication from Haverley reached
him during the following morning. (“I have
since taken occasion to look up the fellow’s
pedigree,” O’Hagan informed me; “and the
fortunes of the family apparently date from
a certain pork butcher by letters patent to
George III. One can understand a lack of
finesse in a scion of sausage-mongers. God
help the Army!”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Noon, and after, saw my friend engaged
upon affairs of his own. But in the evening
Donohue reported in the <span class='it'>mandarah</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This remarkable man is worthy of a brief
inspection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In figure he is sturdy, of no more than
medium height. He has well-brushed hair
of the colour of stale mustard, and a ruddy
complexion. Clean-shaven, his upper lip
usurps an undue share of his countenance, and
his jaw would spell truculence were its significance
not modified by the humorous twinkle
in the sky-blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behold Donohue, a man of attainments;
a valet unsurpassable, of eye more true for
the fold of a cloak than any modiste of the
Rue de la Paix; a colourist in whom discord
between a scarf and a soft shirt produces a
blanching of the cheek; who, of a hundred
waistcoats, having a hundred shades, will
unerringly select <span class='it'>the</span> waistcoat for <span class='it'>the</span>
occasion. He has other qualities, to be displayed
later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donohue: “Sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Donohue?”—O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Haverley, with Lady Rundel
at Folly Theatre; stalls; Row B; numbers
6 and 7.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exit Donohue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This paragon must have delighted the
gloomy soul of Athos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernard O’Hagan, having finished his
coffee, discarded the loose robe for the purple-lined
cloak, pulled on his gloves, and sallied
forth into Whitehall, cloak flying, holding
his cane like an Italian rapier, and generally
comporting himself as some Buckingham
bound for St. James’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his steps in the direction of
the Folly, however. To the box-office
clerk:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I require a stall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have only three vacant, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One will be sufficient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No traffic of the stage that evening had
created anything approximating to the impression
occasioned by O’Hagan’s entrance.
My friend has been called a <span class='it'>poseur</span>. It is
unjust. He cannot help it. Bernard
O’Hagan belongs to the age of plumes and
velvet. His is the soul of a true courtier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just within the big glass door he paused
for a moment, and, the monocle glittering
as he held it before his right eye, studied the
occupants of Row B. Perceiving Lady
Rundel (a conspicuously pretty woman)
staring at him fascinatedly, he bowed. A
hundred sighs arose; a hundred hearts lay
unheeded at the feet of this incomparable
cavalier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haverley devoted his attention exclusively
to the stage. He was gnawing his moustache.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throughout the performance, O’Hagan
lolled back in his stall, one leg negligently
thrown across the other, and studied the
ladies, who constitute the principal attraction
of this house, with a kind of bored
curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the close of the play Lady Rundel and
Captain Haverley stood in the lobby.
O’Hagan bowed low before madame. Then,
to her squire:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I forbade you this lady’s society,
sir?” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are simple remarks which, at certain
times, you or I might make, but which you
and I lack the stark audacity to make. Made,
they strike the listener with a species of
paralysis. This was one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Rundel flushed, and started back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain O’Hagan!” she began——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t speak to him, Lady Rundel!”
came hissing, forced speech from Haverley.
“Allow me to see you to your car. I have
something very particular to say to Captain
O’Hagan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan bowed again inimitably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Lady Rundel. I have something
very particular to say to <span class='it'>you</span> in the
morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan sank reposefully into a
lounge, and, the observed of everyone who
passed out of the theatre, awaited Haverley’s
return. At least a score of ladies inquired
<span class='it'>sotto voce</span> of their escorts: “Who is that
distinguished-looking man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haverley presently returned, forcing his
way roughly against the thinning stream of
supper-seekers. Over the heads of the outgoing,
O’Hagan perceived the drawn face and
angry, blazing eyes. He turned his glass
casually in that direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quivering before him, Haverley said, with
hardly repressed violence:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a blackguard! I have little
doubt that a public brawl would be to your
low taste. But I prefer to call upon you
to-morrow. I shall bring a horse-whip!”
Unable further to trust himself to face the
icy stare which met him, he turned, and
almost ran from the now empty lobby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan swung streetward, in
turn. A taxi-cab had at that moment pulled
up to the kerb; and Haverley was fumbling
with shaking fingers for a coin for the theatre
attendant, ere entering it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan calmly opened the door, stepped
in, and reclosed it. Leaning from the window:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Junior Guards Club!” he said. “Half
a sovereign if you do it in four minutes!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gold is a talisman, my masters. The
taxi-driver risked consequences—and started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“You see,” goes O’Hagan’s explanation
of this episode, “the cab was the last in the
rank, and I had an appointment. Haverley
may have had one also. But pedigree before
pork, Raymond.”)</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk5-4'><span style='font-size:x-large'>IV.</span><br/> DONOHUE’S ORDERS.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>The</span> morning was young, and O’Hagan discussing
rolls and coffee when Donohue
announced Captain Haverley and Mr.
Salter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan rose ceremoniously. He wore a
slate-grey lounge suit, with a silver-grey
plush French knot in lieu of a tie. This
combination suits him admirably and affords
Donohue great scope for discrimination in
the selecting of a soft shirt to harmonise with
the scheme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Entered Haverley, accompanied by a tall
and preternaturally thin gentleman who
carried, a leather case. O’Hagan bowed
coldly to the captain, and upon his companion
turned the monocle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” he said frigidly, sweeping his hand
toward Mr. Salter, “I assume to be your
horse-whip?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Salter is my solicitor!” replied
Haverley loudly. “I have decided that a
public exposure is what you require! We
have therefore——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(O’Hagan pressed a bell.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—I say we have therefore called formally
to advise you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(Donohue entered.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—That a police-court summons for
drunken assault and——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, waving monocle Salterward:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donohue, kindly see this person to the
door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Salter, who was opening his brief-case
looked up alarmedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My solicitor,” shouted Haverley, who
was rapidly losing control of himself, “is——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donohue!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donohue bowed to Mr. Salter and held
wide the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Salter: “Captain O’Hagan, as legal
adviser——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Donohue!</span>”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donohue stepped forward and took up Mr.
Salter’s case. Within his right arm he linked
the left of Mr. Salter, and with the gentle
firmness of a Milo of Crotona led him rapidly
from the room. Came a quavering cry:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will pay dearly for this insult!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haverley, eyes aflame, bounded to the
door. It was locked. He turned to where
O’Hagan, lolling against the mantelpiece,
studied the morning’s manœuvres through
upraised glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not,” explained O’Hagan icily,
“allow solicitors in these chambers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haverley leant back against the door,
almost as though he were preparing for a
spring. He was a man swept by a tornado
of passion, and before its force he quivered
and shook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The law is the weapon of churls,”
continued O’Hagan. “You are a soldier—as
I regret to remind you. Upon the table
on your right are French foils, Italian rapiers,
and three types of sabre. You clearly maintain
your right to Lady Rundel’s society.
I forbid you to see her again. We will settle
the point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haverley cleared his throat, and spoke
huskily:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a madman—and I will see that
you are treated as such——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before we commence,” added O’Hagan,
taking up a writing-block, “we will each
write a note to the effect that we were
practising a new mode of mounted attack,
and that the affair was an accident. One
of these notes will afterwards be destroyed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open the door!” demanded Haverley,
tensely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan observed him with a
kind of unpleasant curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a soldier, and as a gentleman, you
cannot refuse, of course!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open that door! Do you hear me?
You are mad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan swung the monocle, and smiled
upon the rapidly-breathing Haverley with
undisguised contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Haverley,” he said, “Sir Roger
Rundel is my friend; and whilst I live, any
gay Lothario who seeks to gratify his vanity
by compromising my friend’s wife shall find
at least one obstacle in his path. You will
either hand me a written undertaking to
secure a transfer to the 5th, vice Captain
Macklin, invalided—leaving for Burma on
the 19th—or remove that obstacle. You
quit this room upon no other condition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open the door!” roared Haverley,
clenching his fists and grinding his teeth with
animal fury. “Open the door! By God!
I’ll clap you in custody before another hour
has passed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you decline,” said O’Hagan, coldly,
“I will ring for the door to be opened as you
desire——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haverley drummed his right fist into the
palm of his left hand and stamped upon the
floor with his foot. He was literally gasping
in his fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—In order,” resumed the chilly voice,
“that my man may thrash you. I offer
you, for the last time, the satisfaction of a
gentleman——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn your impudent speeches! Open
the door!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan pressed the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened so suddenly and violently
as to precipitate Haverley forward
into the room. He recovered himself, turned,
and sprang with a cry upon Donohue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“Donohue,” O’Hagan has informed me,
“is not of course an adept of the <span class='it'>Higher</span>
Arts of Jiu-Jitsu; but he has a pleasing
proficiency in the more ordinary holds and
falls.”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donohue, then, met the attack in a novel
way. He received Captain Haverley in a
loving embrace. Then, like a teetotum,
Haverley was spun right-about, and held,
purple-faced, eyes starting hideously, with
his arms locked behind him by the human
manacle of Donohue’s iron grip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donohue: “Yes, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have your instructions, Donohue,”
said O’Hagan—and passing the inarticulate
Haverley, strode out of the room.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk5-5'><span style='font-size:x-large'>V.</span><br/> REVELATIONS.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>“The</span> worse a man’s reputation,” Bernard
O’Hagan holds, “the more the women like
him. In French comedy we find the jealous
husband held up to ridicule—hence the
superiority of the lover. Failing the sword,
Ridicule, my boy, is the weapon to cut short
the career of Gallantry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Remembering this, let us accompany
Captain O’Hagan to Lady Rundel’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was admitted. Following upon such
an affair as that of the previous evening,
it is more than doubtful if another had
enjoyed the privilege of admission. But
Bernard O’Hagan is unused to refusals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Rundel received him with studied
coldness. He bent low over her hand in
his remote, courtly fashion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have an explanation to offer of
my conduct of last night,” he explained
blandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am curious to hear it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I do not doubt, Lady Rundel; for
you must have perceived that I strongly
disapproved of the man Haverley!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was caressing a miniature dog, but
at that she glanced up, flushing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a pity,” she began——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is!” agreed O’Hagan, toying with his
monocle. “It is indeed a thousand pities,
for you are such a charmingly pretty
woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain O’Hagan! I fail to understand
you!” But her eyes were less angry than
her tones. “You presume too far, even for
so old a friend, when you attempt to control
my choice of acquaintances!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Lady Rundel”—he bent forward
and patted her hand soothingly—“it annoyed
me so deeply (you know how acutely sensitive
I am) to hear people laughing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Laughing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Rundel met his eyes interrogatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I felt that the position was so very
undignified. Sir Roger——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain O’Hagan—are you insinuating
that people are laughing at my husband
That——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At your husband! At Sir Roger!”
O’Hagan stared amazedly through the pebble.
“No one would dare to laugh at Sir Roger
Rundel, believe me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A far-away look came into Lady Rundel’s
eyes at these words. O’Hagan was glad to
see that look; glad for Sir Roger’s sake. He
knew, then, that his curious duty was almost
accomplished—that Captain Haverley was
merely a passing amusement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Rundel rose slowly from her chair.
O’Hagan observed her slim figure with
smiling, aesthetic appreciation. She walked
across to a small table, glancing at some trifle
which it bore—and turned, leaning back upon
the table-edge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, then?” she asked.
“At whom are they laughing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan shrugged his shoulders with
feigned embarrassment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man who has been tarred and
feathered,” he began——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tarred and feathered!” Her eyes were
opened widely. “Captain O’Hagan! Whatever
do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—Casts ridicule upon any woman who
consents to be seen in his company!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain O’Hagan, be so good as to
explain yourself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan raised his monocle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! you did not know—about
Haverley?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frankly, I cannot believe it!” she cried,
flushing deeply. “I am sure—I am almost
certain—that Captain Haverley would not
submit to such an indignity from <span class='it'>any</span>
man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It <span class='it'>is</span> an indignity, is it not?” he said,
confidentially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I <span class='it'>cannot</span> believe it! And it is
<span class='it'>known</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the singular part of the thing!
I have never been able to understand why
Haverley did not remain abroad. It was
my scamp, Donohue, who perpetrated the
outrage!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your <span class='it'>man</span>! Your man tarred and
feathered Captain Haverley?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He did, the rogue! I would have discharged
the fellow, but he is the only man in
England who knows how to pack dress
trousers in a suit-case!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Rundel was watching O’Hagan.
When he really gets into his stride, my
friend’s mendacity is fascinating. He
becomes supernormally fluent; his truthless
discourse holds one enthralled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The car is ready,” she said slowly. “I
should like to hear this unsavoury story
from the man Donohue himself!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was designed for a home thrust, but
O’Hagan rose delightedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Lady Rundel,” he said. “By all
means You honour me.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk5-6'><span style='font-size:x-large'>VI.</span><br/> DONOHUE AGAIN.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>Some</span> delay occurred at the door of O’Hagan’s
chambers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donohue cannot have gone out,” said he.
“How careless of me to have forgotten my
key!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rang impatiently. Once—twice—thrice.
Then the door was opened some
three inches and Donohue’s face peered
through the aperture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse me, sir,” said that treasure,
ignoring O’Hagan’s icy stare; “but would
you, sir—I don’t ask a favour often—would
you come back in half an hour, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan thrust the door open,
and swept Donohue against the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?” he demanded
fiercely. “Consider yourself discharged,
Donohue! What .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An uproarious banging and shouting
drowned further speech. Lady Rundel
clearly was afraid to enter. Donohue shrank
away before the fierce glare which sought
him through the pebble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Donahue!</span>”—portentously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that unseemly disturbance proceeding
from the store-room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donohue, with great hesitancy:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, sir! You can discharge me
if you like—excuse me, sir, you <span class='it'>have</span>! But
he came here calling you such dirty names,
sir, and—excuse me, m’lady—said things
about her ladyship!——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donohue!” interrupted O’Hagan, in a
voice of freezing calm—“unlock the store-room
door!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Donohue! unlock the store-room door!
Then pack your box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donohue, with a sort of badly veiled
truculence—(“I have always distrusted that
man!” whispered Lady Rundel)—walked
to and unlocked the door indicated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon Lady Rundel uttered a stifled
shriek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For out into view leapt a nightmare
apparition—a man who had sky-blue hair
and only half a moustache! Furthermore,
that surviving half was grass-green!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come out, you piebald spalpeen!” cried
Donohue, throwing restraint to the winds—“come
out and show what I’ve done to
you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Rundel slowly raised her hands to
her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavens!” she said, in a smothered
voice, “it is Bobby Haverley! Captain
O’Hagan, your man must be given in
char.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice trailed off into a suppressed
ripple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lady Rundel!” shouted Haverley
frantically—“This is a conspiracy! I have
been lashed to a chair——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Lady Rundel already was half way
down the stairs, and her laughter, no longer
to be denied, came back in mocking answer.
O’Hagan stood in the doorway, monocle
raised Haverley, by a tremendous effort,
regained control of himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain O’Hagan,” he said, his voice
grating harshly, “you will be in jail to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly,” replied O’Hagan; “but let
us survey the facts. If you care to give me
the written undertaking to which I referred—merely
a matter of form, <span class='it'>now</span>—you may
enjoy the use of the hot and cold water in
my bathroom. The dye will wash out. I
will even lend you a razor. If you decline,
you are at liberty to depart into Whitehall—as
you are! Finally, Donohue has taken
your photograph! You did so, Donohue?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Donohue: “I did, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will, of course, be reproduced in the
press during the course of the case. The
bathroom is on your immediate left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is it necessary to pursue this matter
further? I think not. O’Hagan has not
been prosecuted. He never will be, I fancy.
Recently, he related to Lady Rundel the true
facts of the affair; and I thought that she
would have never ceased laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Bernard O’Hagan’s policy is, Do
it hard, and face the music. One sighs for
a ministry of O’Hagans.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk6-1'><span style='font-size:x-large'>I.</span><br/> WE MEET THE DUKE.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>The</span> character of my friend Bernard
O’Hagan is a maze within a maze, a dædalian
labyrinth, to the heart whereof I long
since have despaired of penetrating. His
sense of humour is acute, but peculiar. A
man, he declares, who cannot laugh at Mark
Twain is a man from whose soul the joy of
life has departed. Yet his idea of bliss would
seem to be existence in a Persian rose-garden
with some few congenial spirits, and, for
attendants, only Greek youths and maidens
of flawless classic beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grotesque anomaly! For I defy any
philosopher to reconcile the ideals of
Petronius Arbiter, Omar, and Samuel
Clemens!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, O’Hagan,” I say, “this world of
ours is a grey place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he turns to me in surprise, monocle
raised, and studies my face with a certain
apprehension.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you say so, Raymond? Have
I not repeatedly demonstrated that Romance
lurks in hiding amid the most prosaic
surroundings? Adventure, my boy, is for
the adventurous! It is only the blind who
deny the existence of fauns. I will undertake
to find you a nymph in any wood.
Villains profound as the darkest dreams of
Tolstoy regularly take tea in the drawing-rooms
of Mayfair; heroes loftier than Charlemagne
jostle one in the Strand!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Potential Cleopatras and Trojan Helens,
I take it, abound in London. Only lacking
is that clash of Circumstance and the Man,
which, in history, has cast up such wondrous
beings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I glance at my picturesque friend,
head aloft, purple-lined cloak swung well
back, and note the air of smiling defiance
wherewith he faces the world, I perceive the
<span class='it'>Man</span>, and with pleasurable anticipation
await the Circumstance. I shall always
remember one conversation of this kind, for
the reason that it directly preceded our meeting
with the Grand Duke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had just quitted the theatre. My
proposal in reference to supper had discovered
the interesting circumstance that
our joint capital equalled three-and-nine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had <span class='it'>you</span> come out without money,”
said O’Hagan, “I should not have been
surprised. Had <span class='it'>I</span> come out without money
I should not have been surprised. But for
us both, on the same evening, to do so,
reveals the finger of Fate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, as he stood with one half of his
face and figure lighted up by the glare of
the theatre lamps, and the other blacked
out in contrasting shadow, bore a resemblance
rather more marked than usual to
the Monarch of merry memory. Withal, he
looked strikingly handsome. He is the only
man of my acquaintance who can successfully
wear a flowing, black dress tie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Bernard O’Hagan is a figure
unforgettable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” I said, impatiently watching
the theatre-goers driving supperward.
“Shall we have something at the club?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Raymond,” replied my friend,
reflectively. “That would be capitulating.
Is it possible that two honourable gentlemen,
chancing to be without half a sovereign or
so, are forced to sup on credit? I recall
an episode in the career of my ancestor,
Patrick.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He is fond of recounting episodes in the
career of this ancestor, Patrick—some time
of the Musketeers of Louis XIII.—a gentleman
who would seem to have been chiefly
notable for suave ruffianism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The nature of the episode I was not destined
to learn, however, at the time; for as
O’Hagan lighted a cigarette, a block in the
traffic occurred at the corner of Wellington
Street (do not misunderstand me to mean
that the incidents were correlative); and a
handsome limousine was held up immediately
in front of us. The interior was brilliantly
illuminated, and a gentleman who lounged
upon the fawn-coloured cushions glanced
curiously in our direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This gentleman, the sole occupant, was
distinguished by fiery moustachios and a
squarely trimmed beard. My association
with what O’Hagan terms “the lower
journalism” has familiarised me with the
faces of notabilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the Grand Duke John of Siresia,”
I volunteered, idly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it is,” said O’Hagan with lively
interest. “So it is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And ere I could say another word he had
stepped to the door of the car, opened it,
and engaged the distinguished foreigner in
conversation!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whilst I knew O’Hagan’s visiting-list to
be extensive and peculiar, I hitherto had
been unaware that he was acquainted with
the Siresian autocrat. His action took
me completely by surprise. Then, just as
the policeman ahead released the pent-up
traffic, my friend turned and beckoned to
me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Full of a great wonder, I joined him at the
open door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get in, Raymond!” he directed briefly,
and thrust me, speechless with astonishment,
into a seat opposite the great personage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chauffeur glanced back. The
footman leapt down and came to the step.
As in a dream, I heard rapid, guttural
instructions. The footman saluted and
leapt to his place. The car moved smoothly
onward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan raised his monocle, gazing at the
bearded nobleman; then waved it gracefully
in my direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may not have met my friend, Mr.
Lawrence Raymond,” he said, with the lordly
condescension which he, alone, knows how to
assume. “Raymond—His Highness the
Grand Duke John of Siresia!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk6-2'><span style='font-size:x-large'>II.</span><br/> WE IMPROVE THE ACQUAINTANCE.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>O’Hagan’s friendship</span> is a passport from the
commonplace to the amazing. In acknowledgment
of this off-handed introduction
I bowed, and was mute. The Grand Duke
nodded. His eyes constantly sought my
nonchalant friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How fortunate,” said the latter smoothly,
“that the traffic chanced to be delayed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bewildered, utterly, I acquitted myself
of an ambiguous nod.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are they?” asked the Grand
Duke suddenly. His delivery was thick,
unmusical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will be good enough to glance
rearward,” replied O’Hagan, “you will
perceive a car which is following closely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were, at that moment, turning around
by Trafalgar Square; so that this prediction
impressed me as being a peculiarly safe one.
The Grand Duke, however, peering through
a little window at the back, turned again
to O’Hagan with palpable uneasiness. His
heavy, dull features marked him a man of
bulldog tenacity and autocratic stupidity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A green car?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, twisting about one finger the
black ribbon attached to his monocle,
inclined his head gravely. The tone of the
Grand Duke’s query had been peremptory—that
of one accustomed to command and to
be slavishly obeyed. My friend’s mode of
reply—the graceful and dignified inclination
of the head, the lowering of the eyelids—had
subtly defined, and with exquisite artistry,
his attitude toward the Grand Duke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that simple inclination he had conveyed:
“Duke”—(it were impossible to imagine
O’Hagan addressing any man breathing as
“Your Highness”)—“Duke, you are in the
company of a gentleman at present amicably
disposed toward you, but of a gentleman
who would as promptly tweak your nose,
should you forget what is due to him, as he
would tweak any other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a silent declaration of aristocracy,
typically and peculiarly O’Haganish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint shade of difference crept into
the Grand Duke’s voice. I doubt if the
man has lived, since Napoleon Buonaparte,
who, meeting Captain the Honble.
Bernard O’Hagan, could have escaped
enmeshment within his catholic patronage.
O’Hagan would patronize the shade
of Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What,” inquired the Grand Duke
awkwardly, “do you propose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First,” said my friend, holding his
monocle between second and third fingers,
and waving it roofward, “extinguish these
interior lights. It was most indiscreet to
travel so publicly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Association with Bernard O’Hagan renders
one more or less accustomed to the <span class='it'>outre</span>.
The amazing ceases to amaze, the appalling
to appal; wonders lose their potency, and
one’s pulse remains normal amid singular
adventures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It afforded me small surprise to see my
friend’s injunction instantly obeyed. (It
would afford me small surprise to see the
Premier blacking O’Hagan’s boots.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Next,” continued the Captain, “direct
your man to drive to your embassy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The obedient Grand Duke bent forward
and called gutturally into the tube.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“There is one thing,” O’Hagan tells me,
“which a nobleman of the Grand Duke’s
race can never appreciate—the doctrine of
aristocratic equality. He must always
dominate or be dominated. My ancestor,
Patrick, had this from the lips of Cardinal
Richelieu—a singularly shrewd observer,
Raymond, and a gentleman.”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no intention,” resumed the Grand
Duke, “of handing them over to the
ambassador.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan shrugged his shoulders impatiently,
turning his eye-glass upon the speaker
with the air of a wise man weary of folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Will</span> you allow me to advise?” he said,
with a certain disdain. “Do <span class='it'>they</span> know
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They cannot possibly,” replied the other.
“It is what they most fear—eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then,” drawled O’Hagan,
yawning discreetly under cover of a gloved
hand, “they will abandon the pursuit and
no attempt will be made upon your private
apartments.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not fear their attempts!” growled
the Grand Duke, with truculent contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My good Duke!” said O’Hagan languidly—“my
dear Duke—do you wish every paper
in Europe to discuss your affairs? Do you
wish all the world to hear of an attempt to
burgle your rooms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What! do you think they would dare?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain O’Hagan surveyed him, pebble
uplifted, as one surveys a surpassing fool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dare!” he said icily. “Dare! My
good, dear Duke—where is your common
sense?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(“That expression marked the psychological
moment, Raymond,” he later was good
enough to inform me. “I was deliberately
tightening the screw. If he submitted. I
knew that the man was mine.”)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Grand Duke glared for a moment.
Then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; you are right!” he agreed,
grudgingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernard O’Hagan would be a dazzling ornament
to the diplomatic service. One can
imagine his prevailing upon the united
monarchies of Europe to present a fleet of
dreadnoughts to Great Britain as a little
token of esteem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is it necessary, by the way, that I mention
here how all this extraordinary conversation
was so much Sanscrit to me? I think not.
I perceived no gleam of light through the
darkness. I was a man in a tunnel leading
he knows not whither, surrounded by he
knows not what.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My bewildered surmisings had come to a
hazy meridian, I think, when the car drew
up before the embassadorial residence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he is at home, what excuse shall I
make for my call?” asked the Grand Duke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any excuse!” said O’Hagan drily.
“You may profess to have heard rumours
that he is troubled with a return of his
gout——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has no gout!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His wife’s gout, then! Anything—anything!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grunting uncouthly, the Grand Duke
alighted and disappeared in the darkness.
Coincident with the footman’s reclosure of
the door, burst forth my dammed up torrent
of queries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ssh!</span>” O’Hagan raised his hand. “I
will explain later, Raymond. Exhibit no
surprise. Merely agree with me—tacitly
agree!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But where did——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Ssh!</span>”—impatiently. “These servants
are spies!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I felt curiously like a screw-stoppered
bottle of some highly aerated mineral, which
has been partially unscrewed. Questions
literally <span class='it'>sizzled</span> from me. But I must perforce
contain myself; and we were presently
rejoined by the Grand Duke. He glanced
up and down the street ere entering. Giving
a brief order to the man:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are they?” he growled, as he
took his seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have left their car,” replied my
friend; “but two of them are in hiding near
the corner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know either of these?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>He</span> is one!” said O’Hagan impressively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whom?” snapped the Grand Duke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Captain O’Hagan is rarely at a loss
for the right word at the right time. He
holds it churlish to stammer and stutter, and
wholly inconsistent with that grand manner
of which, if I be not mistaken, he is the
only surviving master. Yet, now, he seemed
somewhat taken aback. Later, I understood
why. But——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Need you ask?” he returned, with very
brief hesitancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not Leo?” the Grand Duke demanded,
hoarsely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan smiled and inclined his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Siresian nobleman struck his huge fist
into the palm of his hand, furiously. He was
a truly formidable man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse him ten thousand times!” he
shouted, wildly. “How has <span class='it'>he</span> found out
that I have them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear you have been indiscreet, Duke,”
murmured O’Hagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indiscreet!” roared the Grand Duke.
“Not a living soul can have seen me meet
Casimir! Ah, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off, evidently struck by a new
idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was he followed?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear so!” gravely answered my friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They—have him?”—jerkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear so!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Siresian swore, stormily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, well,” he concluded. “He was well
paid for the risk—poor devil!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now we were in the heart of hotel-land.
The car drew up before the dazzling portals
of the New Louvre. The footman threw open
the door and stood rigidly to attention. On
the car-step the Grand Duke hesitated,
turned, and was delivered of a new idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now that I have the letters and the
photographs, what have I to fear?” he
snapped, in an angry voice. “They cannot
reach them here! And do they not
think that I have delivered them to the
embassy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan placed a gloved finger to his lips,
and directed a rapid glance through his
monocle toward a hotel servant who stood
immediately behind the footman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is good of you to bring us along to
supper, Duke!” he cried loudly and breezily.
“Fancy running into you at the Folly of all
places!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Grand Duke accepted the guidance of
this accomplished diplomat. In single file
we entered the hotel—the nobleman frowning
thunderously at the liveried servant silently
impeached of espionage by O’Hagan. To a
suite of apartments furnished with opulent
magnificence we made a stately progress.
When, for a few moments, my surprising
friend and I found ourselves alone, the mental
volcano which raged within me burst into
active eruption, casting forth questions in
a burning torrent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, hand raised: “My dear
Raymond!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I talked on, but diminuendo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, raising monocle: “My dear
fellow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The querulous torrent died away, <span class='it'>poco
a poco</span>. Then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had anticipated all your questions,
my boy,” said O’Hagan; “and I will deal
with them in order. In the first place—No,
I am <span class='it'>not</span> acquainted with the Grand Duke!
I had never seen him in my life until you
drew my attention to him outside the Folly!
I have no idea what it is that he has secured,
and which he evidently apprehends someone
is likely to pursue him in order to recover!—letters
and photographs, according to his
own account. Do not glare in that way,
Raymond; it makes you appear cross-eyed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the door I looked hurriedly, and back
to my nonchalant friend, who swung his
monocle and eyed me with an amused smile.
My tongue defied me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will glance over our conversation,
in retrospect,” he continued, “you will
perceive that my contributions partook of
the nature of leading questions disguised
as items of information. In fact, I adopted
the tactics of an examining magistrate!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It all rests upon this, Raymond. At
the moment when you said, ‘That is the
Grand Duke John,’ you may recall that I
was about to recount to you an exploit
of my ancestor, Patrick? This exploit,
Raymond, was performed before La Rochelle,
and involved three of the enemy, a dozen
bottles of wine, and a game pie! The Grand
Duke is the enemy in this case, my boy.
You must be aware that he is one of a group
whose activities are inimical to our interests
in the Baltic. I saw my way clearly. I
stepped up and whispered to him, ‘They
are following you, Duke! We will slip into
the car, unperceived amid the traffic, and
explain more fully. There must be no delay
here!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>(I inhaled noisily.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This was a bow at venture, Raymond.
The odds against my scoring were about ten
thousand to one. But—as occurred to a
certain Desmond O’Hagan on a somewhat
similar occasion—I scored! Given such
premises, who after that could err?
Although I will confess that I overstepped
the mark once; but, thanks to the darkness
of the car, and the corresponding darkness
prevailing in the Grand Ducal mind, I
recovered! I may add, Raymond, that
our present position, though one of absorbing
interest, is delicate to a degree!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O’Hagan!” I broke in hotly, “this is
beyond belief! Had I known, had I
dreamed, of the false position in which we
were placed——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ceased. Language failed me again.
Then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O’Hagan!” I cried, “what have you
done it for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Primarily,” he answered, “for supper!
After supper I shall offer the Grand Duke
any satisfaction which he may desire.
Secondarily, here <span class='it'>is</span> the Grand Duke!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even as he spoke my mind was busy;
and, as I now perceived with consternation,
O’Hagan had indeed been “pumping” the
Grand Duke—“pumping” him with the
cleverness of a very accomplished K.C. I
was amazed; amazed that the Siresian should
have fallen so easy a victim—that even
Bernard O’Hagan should have had the stark
effrontery to practise such a deception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you will excuse me for a few moments
more,” said the Grand Duke, “I will rejoin
you for supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a cold bow, he left us again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O’Hagan!” I burst out——</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan coughed, and raised his monocle
to his eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—I will not, cannot stay!——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan coughed again, more urgently,
and, across my left shoulder, seemed to focus
something through the pebble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—The supper would choke me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan coughed a third time, with bronchial
violence, bowed low—as a Leicester
before an Elizabeth—and surreptitiously
kicked me shrewdly upon the shin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spun around sharply. I followed the
direction of my friend’s enraptured gaze.
And my eyes rested upon one of the loveliest
women I have ever seen!</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk6-3'><span style='font-size:x-large'>III.</span><br/> THE MAID AND THE RING.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>I call</span> her a woman, but she can have been
no more than seventeen or eighteen, I think.
She was one of those dark, supple Siresian
girls who approach so infinitely nearer to
one’s ideal houri of the East than any really
Oriental beauty ever can do. Her great
black eyes wandered nervously from
O’Hagan’s face to mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me!” she cried, in pretty, broken
English—“I saw you whispering together—tell
me! You are from Leo?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nipping my arm, O’Hagan bowed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew it!” cried the girl joyously.
“Something told me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Good God! at her words, at sight of the
mist of gladness, of gratitude, clouding her
beautiful eyes, I could have kicked myself—I
could have attacked O’Hagan nor counted
the cost!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is so stupid—the Duke,” she ran on,
confidently: “so stupid! He leaves his
coat in there”—she pointed to a distant door—“and
these”—producing a bulky, sealed
parcel—“in the pocket!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she laughed joyously. Her eyes,
though, brimmed over with tears. Her
credulity amazed me, of course; but not so
greatly as one might suppose. There is
something about O’Hagan that women trust
implicitly; and it is something, I contend,
which shall be written to his credit in the
greater Doomsday Book—a real grandeur of
soul which all his surprising superficialities
cannot wholly mask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perceive me, then, at this juncture, a man
rendered helpless by warring emotions,
conflicting doubts, fears, and a supreme
wonderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think you will be in time?”
she pleaded, pressing the packet into his
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so, mademoiselle!” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His handsome face was stern. He had
dropped his monocle, and, with it, I thought,
somewhat of his flippancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They may think he has turned traitor!”
she went on, rapidly: “<span class='it'>he</span>—who has given
up everything to the Cause! But they will
be furious—they will not reason! Even now,
monsieur, they may be condemning him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her use of the word “monsieur” set me
wondering. Her voice broke. Her brave
eyes grew dim. And a lump rose in my throat.
For I had perceived the reality of her trouble,
and I think I had never felt a more despicable
scoundrel. I thought that, as a man and a
gentleman, I truly was not worth our united
three-and-ninepence! What should I do?
How should I act? Thus, miserably, I
searched my inert intelligence; then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” began my friend, succinctly—“I
cannot go among them, because I am not
one of them! Do not be afraid. I am a true
friend to the Cause and to Leo. But how
may I reach him?—where do they meet
to-night? And are you certain that he will
be there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shadow—a vague shadow—clouded the
girl’s face. Anxiously, intently, she watched
O’Hagan; and this he perceived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mademoiselle,” he said, with a frank
pride which is his peculiar birthright—“it
is not possible that you can mistrust my
word! Upon my honour, I will deliver this
packet as you direct, and no man shall hinder
me. But you must tell me where they meet,
and how I may gain admittance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment more she hesitated—searching
his face with big, anxious eyes. Then
dawned the light of a great resolution; and
I knew that she had determined to trust to
her instincts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” she said, hastily pulling a ring
from her finger. “Show this to the woman
in the shop before the Café de l’Orient, Greek
Street, and say ‘Warsaw.’ You will be
admitted. Give the packet to Leo or to the
President; to no one else! Quick! go,
I implore you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan took the ring, raised the girl’s
white fingers to his lips, and bowed over her
hand as over the hand of a queen. It was the
farewell of an old-time courtier and most
perfect gentleman—completely untheatrical,
exquisitely dignified. At such moments you
perceive in my friend the ideal cavalier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face flushed rosily—and paled to a
greater pallor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the doorway O’Hagan turned again
and bowed. Then, straight downstairs we
hastened—he with the package in an inside
pocket—and through to the street, unquestioned.
A taxi-cab had just discharged
a visitor at the door, and O’Hagan detained
the man with a short, imperious gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We leapt in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Café de l’Orient, Greek Street,” said
my friend. “Three-and-nine if you get there
in five minutes!”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:2em;'>—————</p>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='bk6-4'><span style='font-size:x-large'>IV.</span><br/> THE CONSPIRATORS.</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'>The</span> cab having moved on,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I regret,” began O’Hagan, “that we have
missed our supper! But I have triumphantly
proven my words anent the survival
of Romance. You note into what a surprising
adventure we have blundered merely
by honouring a Grand Duke with our company!
Here we have all the elements of
a stirring romance indeed: the autocratic
nobleman, the distressed lovers, the ring
as a token! I am delighted, Raymond!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O’Hagan!” I interrupted sternly—“if
<span class='it'>you</span> are delighted, I am appalled! Of the
deception practised upon the Duke I will
say nothing; but to have tricked a girl who
confided——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop!” cried O’Hagan imperiously.
“Stop there, Raymond! You!—my friend—and
charge me with such a crime!
Raymond!——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She thinks,” I interrupted, excitedly——</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She thinks,” my friend took me up,
“that we are acquainted with her secrets,
and trusts us accordingly. Good. Is her
trust misplaced? Do we intend to betray
her? No! ten thousand times no! It
is perfectly evident that her lover—Christian
name, Leo; surname, unknown; nationality,
possibly Polish—is involved in some
conspiracy directed against a government—probably
that of Russia. Her father, or
guardian, our mutual acquaintance the Duke,
had obtained, through the treachery of one
Casimir, proofs of Leo’s complicity. These,
we may assume, he intended to employ—(a)
to frustrate Leo’s designs in regard to the
lady; (b) to bring about the arrest, or ruin,
of the said Leo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delightful, my boy! Wildly and picturesquely
romantic! Enter Lawrence
Raymond and Bernard O’Hagan—and what
becomes of the ducal plan? It miserably
crumbles to dust! Virtue and Love are
triumphant, and we are the heroes of the
hour!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cab stopped before a dingy little café.
Our entire capital O’Hagan lavished upon
the man, and we entered the café.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Its front portion proved to consist of a shop
where coffee-pots and such utensils were
sold, and behind the counter sat an adipose
and unctuous lady of considerable maturity.
O’Hagan’s entrance brought her to her feet
in quick alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My friend held the ring before her eyes.
She viewed it in palpable wonder, her slightly
crooked gaze vacillating betwixt the face of
my cavalierly friend and my own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Warsaw!</span>” said O’Hagan, magnificently—and
swept his arm toward a dirty glass-panelled
door on our right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oui, monsieur!” mumbled the old
woman; and shuffled around the counter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without properly realising by what stages
I had come there, I found myself standing
before the closed door of an upper-floor
room. O’Hagan knocked. A shouted conversation,
rising, a harsh <span class='it'>duetto</span>, above an
angry chorus, ceased abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan threw wide the door and strode
into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was small, smelling strongly of stale
coffee and caporal cigarettes, and was
illuminated by a gas burner low hung above
a square table. About the table sat eight
or ten foreigners—seemingly Russians or
Poles—nearly all of whom leapt to their feet
at our appearance. One, an old man with
a venerable white beard, rose with greater
dignity, fixing his brilliant eyes upon my
friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan rested one hand upon his hip,
and with the other held the monocle an
inch or so removed from his right eye.
Amid a magnetic silence:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen,” he said, with a sort of
frigid courtesy—“and good people—you will
favour me by resuming your seats!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of this gracious permission no one availed
himself. An angry muttering arose, and—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your business?” demanded the
venerable chairman, in excellent English.</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, through upraised glass, studied
each face in turn and attentively. The
muttering grew, and grew, and became a
simian clamour. All eyes were turned to
my nonchalant friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My business, monsieur,” he replied—speaking
in French, probably with the idea that
the rest of the company would be more
likely to understand him—“is of the utmost
gravity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The uproar waxed louder. One swarthy,
thickset fellow turned and took a step in
O’Hagan’s direction. O’Hagan raised his
glass again—and the fellow sat down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” resumed my friend icily, “until
a perfect silence is preserved I shall not
disclose it” (louder uproar than ever); “I
am not accustomed to interruption by the
rabble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silence fell—save that it was a murderous
silence. But:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your rebuke is just,” said the aged
spokesman, glaring fiercely around. “I will
see to it that you are not interrupted. Your
business, monsieur?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is,” replied O’Hagan, “to denounce a
traitor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that a perfect howl went up. Chairs
crashed back upon the floor; and the discussion,
which evidently had been interrupted
by our entrance, was now resumed with
renewed violence. All eyes turned upon a
dark young man sitting on the right of the
chairman. His handsome, aristocratic face
was deathly pale, and his fine nostrils
quivered with some emotion hardly repressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence!” roared the chairman, in
clarion tones, and struck his fist upon the
table with a resounding bang. “Silence!
Are you mad, that you dispute with strangers
present!” He glared about him ominously.
“Again, monsieur”—to O’Hagan—“what is
your business?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan paused awhile, staring down a
man who continued to mutter rapidly to his
right-hand neighbour. Then—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The letters and photographs,” began my
friend, as one whose patience wearies——</p>

<p class='pindent'>But yet again he was interrupted, and now,
by the dark young man; who leapt from his
place, a hectic flush colouring his pale cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have them, monsieur?” he cried,
holding his outstretched hands towards us.
“God! you have them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have just recovered them from the
apartments of the Grand Duke John!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>High heaven! Never can I forget the
shriek of execration that greeted the name
of the Grand Duke! We seemed, in a
moment, to be surrounded by fiends of
the uttermost darkness. They mowed and
gibbered like animal things. Only the dark
young fellow retained any self-control—sinking
back upon his chair and biting his lip.
But his eyes were glad; and by his eyes it
was that I knew him for Leo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence!” came the mighty voice again.
And the terrible old man glared about him,
quelling his unruly compatriots like a pack
of dogs. “Hand me those letters, monsieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan, amid another throbbing stillness,
produced the package.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I addressing,” he inquired, “the
gentleman known as the President?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am the President, monsieur,” he was
answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My friend passed the package to the old
man. Rapidly, the latter broke the seals
and examined the contents. Intense expectancy
was written upon every face. It
seemed that life or death hung upon the
result of his examination. This, however
was brief. Placing the bundle upon the
table before him—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brothers,” he said, with some emotion,
“a great danger is providentially averted.
All are here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in his look suppressed the
mighty shout almost ere it left the throats
of the shouters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said, monsieur,” he continued, turning
his eyes upon O’Hagan, “that you would
denounce to us a traitor. I do not know who
you are nor whence you come; but you
have to-night done that which shows you a
friend. You have saved the lives—and more
than the lives—of some who never forget,
and who will be grateful while they have
hearts that beat. Your actions prove you:
your words shall be respected. Name the
traitor amongst us, monsieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The simple dignity of the old man’s
speech and manner impressed me immensely,
but the eyes that glared from all around the
table were not pleasant to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For what I have done,” said O’Hagan
slowly, “I claim a reward: the immunity
of the man I shall denounce!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The necessity for the words was rendered
evident by the negative yell which answered
them; it was, however, immediately checked
by the President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The reward you claim is a high one,
monsieur,” he said, “and wholly contrary
to the rules of our Order! But the service
you have rendered is beyond all human
recompense. Therefore I grant your request.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some few murmurs arose; but a glance
from the fiery old eyes restored complete
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The traitor,” announced O’Hagan, “is
called Casimir!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You lie!” screamed a man wearing a
short, red beard, leaping madly to his feet.
“Curse you! you lie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>O’Hagan focussed him through the
monocle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was with the Grand Duke when you
handed him the packet,” he said, with a
sort of suppressed ferocity—“you brick-dust
baboon!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were not!” shrieked the other.
“The Grand Duke was alone——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped. His florid face blanched to
a mottled white, and he dropped back, the
picture of a rogue unmasked. Then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, monsieur,” said O’Hagan to
the President, “I have indicated your
traitor and he has condemned himself; for
the Grand Duke <span class='it'>was</span> alone!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I expected a veritable pandemonium to
burst upon us; but my expectation was not
realised. The man seated beside Casimir
turned, and with a cold smile, but blazing
eyes, struck him deliberately across the face
with his open hand. The outraged rascal
bounded again to his feet; but a look
around the silent company was enough.
One quick glance he directed toward the
old man, who stood with finger rigidly pointed
to the door, and, head bent, he shuffled past
us—and was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, certainly, a scene of the wildest
enthusiasm ensued. Everybody present
seemed bent upon embracing Leo; but,
escaping from his excited fellows, he came and
took both O’Hagan’s hands in his own,
turning then to me, and shaking mine as
warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen,” he said, in very fair English,
“I will not attempt to thank you. I only
thank God that there are such as you in
the world!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Devilish embarrassing!” O’Hagan confessed
to me, later, “considering the real
objective of the expedition—<span class='it'>id est</span>:
supper!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” said my friend, “is something to
which you have a better claim than I.” He
handed Leo the ring. “To that brave lady
you owe everything, sir; to us, nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She will always bless you,” said the other,
kissing the ring reverently—“as I bless her!
I do not know your names, gentlemen—nor,
in the circumstances, ask them. But if ever
Fate should lead you to Poland, the home of
Count Leo Riersiwicz is <span class='it'>your</span> home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite a charming little adventure,” said
O’Hagan, as we passed westward; “save
that one cannot sympathise with any man
who elects to associate with such a crew of
undesirable pole-cats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two peers, a newspaper proprietor, and an
actor-manager waited upon the kerb of Oxford
Circus, whilst ’bus drivers, draymen, vanmen
on vans and other impossibles, drove by.
O’Hagan’s procedure on occasions of this
kind is a joy unique and a memory ineffaceable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Regardless of the direction, language,
behaviour, or wishes of such persons, he proceeds
across the road at the same dignified
and even pace which he had observed upon
the pavement. With dray horses standing
on their hind-legs and waving their fore-legs
over his picturesque head, with taxi-cabs
menacing plate-glass windows, and motor
’busses hastily diverting their routes, he pauses
to light an Egyptian cigarette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having returned his gold matchbox to his
waistcoat pocket, unruffled he pursues his
way, the only extant example of the <span class='it'>grand
seigneur</span>.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
